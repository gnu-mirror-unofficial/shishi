purpose "Manipulate information stored in the Shisa user database."

section "Operations"
option "add" a "Add realm or principal to database." no
option "dump" d "Dump entries in database." no
option "key-add" n "Add new key to a principal in database." no
option "key-remove" - "Remove a key from a principal in database." no
option "list" l "List entries in database." no
option "modify" m "Modify principal entry in database." no
option "remove" r "Remove realm or principal from database." no

section "Parameters"
option "force" f "Allow removal of non-empty realms.\n" flag off
option "enabled" - "Only dump or list enabled principals.\n" flag off
option "disabled" - "Only dump or list disabled principals.\n" flag off
option "keys" - "Print cryptographic key and password in hostkey format." flag off

section "Values"
option "encryption-type" E "Override default key encryption type.  Valid values include 'aes128', 'aes256', 'aes' (same as 'aes256'), '3des', 'des-md5', 'des-md4', 'des-crc', 'des' (same as 'des-md5'), and 'arcfour'." string no
