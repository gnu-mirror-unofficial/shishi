   *
   * Whenever a request is made to the ticket-granting server, the
   * presented ticket(s) is(are) checked against a hot-list of tickets
   * which have been canceled. This hot-list might be implemented by
   * storing a range of issue timestamps for 'suspect tickets'; if a
   * presented ticket had an authtime in that range, it would be rejected.
   * In this way, a stolen ticket-granting ticket or renewable ticket
   * cannot be used to gain additional tickets (renewals or otherwise)
   * once the theft has been reported to the KDC for the realm in which
   * the server resides. Any normal ticket obtained before it was reported
   * stolen will still be valid (because they require no interaction with
   * the KDC), but only until their normal expiration time. If TGT's have
   * been issued for cross-realm authentication, use of the cross-realm
   * TGT will not be affected unless the hot-list is propagated to the
   * KDCs for the realms for which such cross-realm tickets were issued.

   * for the new ticket plus the life (endtime-starttime) of the old
   * ticket.
   *
   * If the FORWARDED option has been requested, then the resulting ticket
   * will contain the addresses specified by the client. This option will
   * only be honored if the FORWARDABLE flag is set in the TGT. The PROXY

   * flag in the TGT is set. The PROXY option will not be honored on

   * is not set in the TGT, then the error KDC_ERR_CANNOT_POSTDATE is
   * returned. Otherwise, if the ticket-granting ticket has the MAY-
   * POSTDATE flag set, then the resulting ticket will be postdated and
   * the requested starttime is checked against the policy of the local
   * realm. If acceptable, the ticket's start time is set as requested,

   * reached. However, in no case may the starttime, endtime, or renew-
   * till time of a newly-issued postdated ticket extend beyond the renew-
   * till time of the ticket-granting ticket.
   *
   * If the ENC-TKT-IN-SKEY option has been specified and an additional
   * ticket has been included in the request, it indicates that the client
   * is using user- to-user authentication to prove its identity to a
   * server that does not have access to a persistent key. Section 3.7
   * describes the affect of this option on the entire Kerberos protocol.
   * When generating the KRB_TGS_REP message, this option in the
   * KRB_TGS_REQ message tells the KDC to decrypt the additional ticket
   * using the key for the server to which the additional ticket was
   * issued and verify that it is a ticket-granting ticket. If the name of
   * the requested server is missing from the request, the name of the
   * client in the additional ticket will be used. Otherwise the name of
   * the requested server will be compared to the name of the client in
   * the additional ticket and if different, the request will be rejected.
   * If the request succeeds, the session key from the additional ticket
   * will be used to encrypt the new ticket that is issued instead of
   * using the key of the server for which the new ticket will be used.
   *
   * If the name of the server in the ticket that is presented to the KDC
   * as part of the authentication header is not that of the ticket-
   * granting server itself, the server is registered in the realm of the
   * KDC, and the RENEW option is requested, then the KDC will verify that
   * the RENEWABLE flag is set in the ticket, that the INVALID flag is not
   * set in the ticket, and that the renew_till time is still in the
   * future. If the VALIDATE option is requested, the KDC will check that
   * the starttime has passed and the INVALID flag is set. If the PROXY
   * option is requested, then the KDC will check that the PROXIABLE flag
   * is set in the ticket. If the tests succeed, and the ticket passes the
   * hotlist check described in the next section, the KDC will issue the
   * appropriate new ticket.
