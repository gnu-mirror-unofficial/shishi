/**
 * shishi_realm_default_guess:
 *
 * Guesses a realm based on getdomainname(), which really responds
 * with a NIS/YP domain, but if set properly, it might be a good
 * first guess.  If this NIS query fails, call gethostname(),
 * and on its failure, fall back to returning the artificial
 * string "could-not-guess-default-realm".
 *
 * Note that the hostname is not trimmed off of the string returned
 * by gethostname(), thus pretending the local host name is a valid
 * realm name.  The resulting corner case could merit a check that
 * the suggested realm is distinct from the fully qualifies host,
 * and if not, simply strip the host name from the returned string
 * before it is used in an application.  One reason for sticking
 * with the present behaviour, is that some systems respond with
 * a non-qualified host name as reply from gethostname().
 *
 * Return value: Returns a guessed realm for the running host,
 *   containing a string that has to be deallocated with
 *   free() by the caller.

/**
 * shishi_realm_for_server_dns:
 * @handle: Shishi library handle created by shishi_init().
 * @server: Hostname to find realm for.
 *
 * Finds the realm for a host @server using DNS lookup, as is
 * prescribed in "draft-ietf-krb-wg-krb-dns-locate-03.txt".
 *
 * Since DNS lookup can be spoofed, relying on the realm information
 * may result in a redirection attack.  In a single-realm scenario,
 * this only achieves a denial of service, but with trust across
 * multiple realms the attack may redirect you to a compromised realm.
 * For this reason, Shishi prints a warning, suggesting that the user
 * should instead add a proper 'server-realm' configuration token.
 *
 * To illustrate the DNS information used, here is an extract from a
 * zone file for the domain ASDF.COM:
 *
 * _kerberos.asdf.com.             IN   TXT     "ASDF.COM"
 * _kerberos.mrkserver.asdf.com.   IN   TXT     "MARKETING.ASDF.COM"
 * _kerberos.salesserver.asdf.com. IN   TXT     "SALES.ASDF.COM"
 *
 * Let us suppose that in this case, a client wishes to use a service
 * on the host "foo.asdf.com".  It would first query for
 *
 * _kerberos.foo.asdf.com.  IN TXT
 *
 * Finding no match, it would then query for
 *
 * _kerberos.asdf.com.      IN TXT
 *
 * With the resource records stated above, the latter query returns
 * a positive answer.
 *
 * Return value: Returns realm for the indicated host, or %NULL
 *   if no relevant TXT record could be found.
