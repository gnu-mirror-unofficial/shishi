 * trusted KDCs are relied upon to authenticate a principal.  The
 * transited field in the ticket identifies which realms (and thus
 * which KDCs) were involved in the authentication process and an
 * application server would normally check this field. If any of these
 * are untrusted to authenticate the indicated client principal
 * (probably determined by a realm-based policy), the authentication
 * attempt MUST be rejected. The presence of trusted KDCs in this list
 * does not provide any guarantee; an untrusted KDC may have
 * fabricated the list.
 *
 * While the end server ultimately decides whether authentication is
 * valid, the KDC for the end server's realm MAY apply a realm
 * specific policy for validating the transited field and accepting
 * credentials for cross-realm authentication. When the KDC applies
 * such checks and accepts such cross-realm authentication it will set
 * the TRANSITED-POLICY-CHECKED flag in the service tickets it issues
 * based on the cross-realm TGT. A client MAY request that the KDCs
 * not check the transited field by setting the
 * DISABLE-TRANSITED-CHECK flag. KDCs are encouraged but not required
 * to honor this flag.
 *
 * Application servers MUST either do the transited-realm checks
 * themselves, or reject cross-realm tickets without TRANSITED-POLICY-
 * CHECKED set.
