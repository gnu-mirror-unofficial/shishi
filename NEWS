* Version 1.0.3 (unreleased)

** Update gnulib files and translations.

* Version 1.0.2 (released 2013-04-03)

** libshishi: Fix server-realm handling.
Reported by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** libshishi: Fix salt derivation for principals with multiple components.
Before, when adding a principal such as "user/admin" using shisa it
would use the wrong salt.  Reported by Mats Erik Andersson
<gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** libshishi: Fix setting principals with multiple components in encticketpart.
Before, the shishid KDC would return the wrong client principal name
in a KDC-REP when principals such as "user/admin" were used.  That
would lead to errors when getting a ticket for such principals.
Reported by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** libshishi: Fixes to .k5login authorization.
Patch by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** shishid: The syslog facility is now LOG_AUTH instead of LOG_DAEMON.
Suggested by Mats Erik Andersson <gnu@gisladisker.se>.

** Update gnulib files.
Including moving the 'stat' module from db/ to gl/ so that libshishi
builds properly.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 0.0.42 (released 2010-03-15)

** libshishi: Add APIs to save keys on keytab format.
The functions are shishi_keys_to_keytab_file and
shishi_keys_to_keytab_mem.

** libshishi: Add APIs to retrieve/set the timestamp for a key.
Typically only used by keytab format.  The functions are
shishi_key_timestamp and shishi_key_timestamp_set.

** libshishi: Add API to read several keys from a file.
The function is shishi_keys_from_file.

** keytab2shishi: Add --reverse (-R) parameter to write Keytab files.
This allows you to use create Keytab files from your Shishi hostkeys.

** libshishi: Fix bug where '3des' is parsed as 'des'.

** minitasn1: Internal copy upgraded to GNU Libtasn1 v2.5.

** API and ABI modifications:
shishi_key_timestamp: ADD.
shishi_key_timestamp_set: ADD.
shishi_keys_from_file: ADD.
shishi_keys_to_keytab_file: ADD.

** Update many gnulib files.

** minitasn1: Internal copy upgraded to GNU Libtasn1 v2.4.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 0.0.40 (released 2009-04-03)

** shisa: Fix bug that made command line parameter parsing unreliable.

** Shishi can now be cross-compiled to Windows using MinGW.
See <http://josefsson.org/gnutls4win/> for build scripts and pre-built
binary packages.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 0.0.39 (released 2009-03-30)

** libshishi: The linker version script lists APIs explicitly.
This will reduce the chance that a symbol is exported accidentally.

** libshisa: Use a LD version script on platforms where it is supported.
Currently only GNU LD and the Solaris linker supports it.  This helps
Debian package tools to produce better dependencies.  Before we used
Libtool -export-symbols-regex that created an anonymous version tag.
We still fall back on -export-symbols-regex if the system does not
support LD version scripts, although on most platforms this will just
affect symbol visibility.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 0.0.38 (released 2009-02-26)

** libshisa: Use libtool -export-symbols-regex to fix exported namespace.

** doc: Change license on the manual to GFDLv1.3+.

** minitasn1: Internal copy updated to libtasn1 v1.8.

** More compiler warnings enabled, and many warnings fixed.

** API and ABI modifications:
No changes since last version.

* Version 0.0.37 (released 2008-06-24)

** libshishi: New functions to set a password prompt callback.
You register the callback using shishi_prompt_password_callback_set
and can retrieve the current callback using
shishi_prompt_password_callback_get.  The callback function should
follow the shishi_prompt_password_func function prototype.  The
shishi_prompt_password function has been updated to call the
callbacks, if registered.  Inspired by discussion with Graham Shaw
<gdshaw@riscpkg.org>.

** libshishi: New ticketset hint flag SHISHI_TKTSHINTFLAGS_NON_INTERACTIVE.
When this flag is passed to ticketset functions, it will never query
the user for a password.  Inspired by discussion with Graham Shaw
<gdshaw@riscpkg.org>.

** libshishi: When doing pre-authentication with a pre-seeded password,
** don't ask for a new password.
Reported by Graham Shaw <gdshaw@riscpkg.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.shishi.general/494>.

** libshishi: add new function to debug print ASN.1 structures.
shishi_asn1_print: ADD.

** libshishi: Cleanup type declaration of Shishi_asn1.
Now it is mapped to ASN1_TYPE if you included libtasn1.h, otherwise to
'void*'.

** Update examples for new API.
Now the examples are also built by default, so we notice any build
failures for them.

** Translations files not stored directly in git to avoid merge conflicts.
This allows us to avoid use of --no-location which makes the
translation teams happier.

** Dist gdoc-error to avoid build failures when building modified sources.
Reported by Graham Shaw <gdshaw@riscpkg.org> in
<http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.gnu.shishi.general/497>.

** Internal copy of libtasn1 updated to version 1.4.

** Update gnulib files.

** New APIs to deal with password queries.
SHISHI_TKTSHINTFLAGS_NON_INTERACTIVE
shishi_prompt_password_callback_set
shishi_prompt_password_callback_get
shishi_prompt_password_func

* Version 0.0.36 (released 2008-02-14)

** Fix warnings in generated man pages (silence lintian).

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 0.0.35 (released 2008-02-07)

** Warnings about missing configuration files are only printed once.

** Fix debug message printing.

** Fix non-portable use of brace expansion in makefiles.

* Version 0.0.34 (released 2008-01-16)

** Several code fixes for MinGW.
A mingw build now compiles and passes the self-tests under Wine.

** When built under MinGW, generate a libshishi-XX.def using -Wl,--output-def.
Useful when developing applications with Visual Studio.

** Use gettext 0.17.

** Update and re-factor gnulib files.
There is now a new gnulib directory src/gl/ and db/gl/ for those
modules that aren't needed by libshishi, but used by the command-line
tools and libshisa, respectively.

** If syslog is not available, shishid is not built.
Implementing an alternative logging mechanism is needed in order to
re-enable building shishid on platforms that lack syslog.

** New types for DNS classes:
SHISHI_DNS_IN: New #define.

* Version 0.0.33 (released 2007-09-14)

** libpam_shishi: Don't echo password when reading it from console.
Reported by Jack Bates <ms419@freezone.co.uk>.

** libpam_shishi: Save read password in PAM library for other modules.
Reported by Jack Bates <ms419@freezone.co.uk>.

** Update translations.

* Version 0.0.32 (released 2007-06-29)

** Shishi is now licensed under the GPL version 3 or later.

** Remove extra/inetutils.diff since the patch has been merged into InetUtils.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 0.0.31 (released 2007-06-11)

** Shishi is now developed using Git instead of CVS.
A public git mirror is available from
<http://repo.or.cz/w/shishi.git>.

** Verify the KDC's certificate against a CA certificate in the client.
The CA is by default stored in ~/.shishi/client.ca in PEM format.
Suggested by Alberto Fondi <alberto.fondi@lnf.infn.it>.

** Update gnulib files.

* Version 0.0.30 (released 2006-11-01)

** Update STARTTLS extension to match latest drafts.
Shishi now implements draft-josefsson-krb-tcp-expansion-02.txt and
draft-josefsson-kerberos5-starttls-02.txt.

** Fix failure when reading large integers from ASN.1 structure.
This can manifest itself by giving error messages such as 'Replay
protection value (nonce) differ between request and reply.'.  Added a
new self test "nonce" to detect errors in these routines.  Reported by
Alberto Fondi.

* Version 0.0.29 (released 2006-11-01)

** Add man page for ccache2shishi.

* Version 0.0.28 (released 2006-11-01)

** New command line tool "ccache2shishi".
The tool will read tickets from /tmp/krb5cc_UID (by default) and will
write them to ~/.shishi/tickets.

** A description of the ccache file format were added in doc/ccache.txt.

** A self-contained standalone parser of the ccache format added.
See lib/ccache.h and lib/ccache.c.  The intention is that they should
be usable outside of Shishi, and it doesn't use any Shishi specific
header files or functions.  It also avoids heap memory handling.

** New APIs to read MIT ccache files.
shishi_tkts_add_ccache_mem
shishi_tkts_add_ccache_file
shishi_tkts_from_ccache_mem
shishi_tkts_from_ccache_file

** New APIs to support ccache reading.
shishi_enckdcreppart_authtime_set
shishi_enckdcreppart_starttime_set
shishi_enckdcreppart_renew_till_set
shishi_tkts_default_ccache_guess
shishi_tkts_default_ccache
shishi_tkts_default_ccache_set

** Fix build errors for missing arcfour_stream when using --with-libgcrypt.
Reported by abhijit mitra <abhijit_kly@yahoo.co.in>.

* Version 0.0.27 (released 2006-09-15)

** New command line tool "keytab2shishi".
The tool will read host keys from /etc/krb5.keytab (by default) and
will write them to $(prefix)/etc/shishi.keys.

** New APIs to read MIT keytab files.
Thanks to Michael B Allen who reverse-engineered the format and
published a freely licensed description, available from
<http://www.ioplex.com/utilities/keytab.txt>.  The APIs are
shishi_keys_add_keytab_mem, shishi_keys_add_keytab_file,
shishi_keys_from_keytab_mem, and shishi_keys_from_keytab_file.

** New APIs to manage set of keys.
shishi_keys
shishi_keys_done
shishi_keys_size
shishi_keys_nth
shishi_keys_remove
shishi_keys_add
shishi_keys_print
shishi_keys_to_file

** Libtasn1 updated to 0.3.6.
This fixes a bug that caused self-test failures in Shishi on 64-bit
platforms.

** Remove path from syslog messages for shishid.

** Update of gnulib files.

** Some minor code cleanups.

* Version 0.0.26 (released 2006-05-15)

** Requests for service tickets (TGS) are now sent without a sub-session key.
This solves interop problems with Windows 2003 and Heimdal, thanks to
Elrond for debugging.

** Fix buggy MD4 implementation on 64-bit platforms.

** The Shishi PAM module in extra/pam-shishi/ is now built by default.
The installation path has also been changed to $prefix/lib/security,
but you can change it with `configure --with-pam-dir=/somewhere/else'
or `make install PAMDIR=/somewhere/else'.

** Fix mem leaks.

** Self-tests are now run under valgrind, if it is installed.

** Updated Polish translation, thanks to Jakub Bogusz.

* Version 0.0.25 (released 2006-04-27)

** Fix bug in code to get service tickets.
The problem was in the libtasn1 DER encoder which include ASN.1 tags
for SEQUENCE members when calling asn1_der_coding() on a SEQUENCE
element, thanks to Elrond for debugging.

** Improved handling of key versions.
Shishi should not send kvno for a session keys in TGS requests any
more.  Internally, the UINT32_MAX kvno is now used to denote a
"kvno"-less (i.e., non-permenant) key, earlier 0 was used which
collided with the perfectly valid real kvno of 0.

** Improved translation of messages in shishi.

** Doc fixes.

* Version 0.0.24 (released 2006-04-22)

** Fix bug in shishid which caused it to listen on standard input and crash.

** Pre-authentication support.
Only the PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP, ETYPE-INFO and ETYPE-INFO2 mechanisms are
supported.  Tested againt MIT, Heimdal, and Windows 2003 KDCs.

** Clarified the copyright on lib/kerberos5.asn1.

** Updated gnulib compatibility files.

** Fix some memory leaks and crashes.

* Version 0.0.23 (released 2006-03-25)

** Debian packages are available from http://josefsson.org/shishi/debian/
Thanks to Russ Allbery, Yvan Bassuel and Elrond for help on the Debian
packaging.

** Added shishi_derive_default_salt and shishi_key_from_name APIs.
Used to create a key from principal and password.  Suggested by Elrond
<elrond@samba-tng.org>.

** Replace internal crypto code with modules from gnulib.

** Added shared library versioning script, suggested by Steve Langasek.

** Improved libidn detection code.

** The manual doesn't have any invariant sections.

** Updated gnulib compatibility files.

** Updated libtasn1.

** Minor bugfixes and improvements.

* Version 0.0.22 (released 2005-08-10)

** Fix build error when STARTTLS support is enabled.

* Version 0.0.18 (released 2004-10-15)

** When generating an AP-REP, the generated EncAPRepPart is now remembered.

** Fix some memory leaks.

** Revamp of autogenerated documentation.

** Documentation improvements.

** Included libtasn1 updated to 0.2.11.

** ASN.1 API cleanup:
shishi_new_a2d: RENAMED to shishi_asn1_to_der.
shishi_a2d_new_field: RENAMED to shishi_asn1_to_der_field.
shishi_a2d, shishi_a2d_field: REMOVED.
shishi_asn1_read: RENAMED to shishi_asn1_read_inline.
shishi_asn1_read2: RENAMED to shishi_asn1_read.
shishi_asn1_read2_optional: RENAMED to shishi_asn1_read_optional.
shishi_asn1_read_optional: MODIFIED, now allocate output.

** Various other API fixes.
Functions that take fixed size buffers have been replaced by functions
that allocate dynamically sized buffer of the correct length.

* Version 0.0.17 (released 2004-08-08)

** Revamp of gnulib compatibility files.

** Fix warnings.

* Version 0.0.16 (released 2004-08-01)

** New environment variables to override defaults in Shishi library.
SHISHI_USER specifies default client username, SHISHI_HOME specifies
user Shishi home directory (for configuration file, ticket cache,
etc), SHISHI_TICKETS the ticket cache file, SHISHI_CONFIG for the
system configuration file, SHISHI_KEYS for system wide host keys.

** Experimental KDC now handle non-default ticket life time.

** Nettle is now preferred over Libgcrypt, even if Libgcrypt is available.
Use configure parameter --with-libgcrypt to override.  Nettle is the
minimalistic crypto library included with Shishi.

** The pkg-config script no longer use the linker parameter -R.

** Libtasn1 updated to 0.2.10.

** Many gnulib compatibility files were updated.

** Cross compile builds should work.
It should work for any sane cross compile target, but the only tested
platform is uClibc/uClinux on Motorola Coldfire.

* Version 0.0.15 (released 2004-04-18)

** Sequence numbers in Authenticator and EncAPRepPart are now randomized.

** Low-level fixes of AES Cipher Text Stealing mode.
Also added more AES/CTS self tests.

** Configuration tokens spelled correctly ("verbose-noice" -> "verbose-noise").

** Polish translation added, by Jakub Bogusz.

** Various bugfixes and cleanups.

* Version 0.0.14 (released 2004-01-22)

** High-level AP interface now support setting raw checksum field values.
This is needed for certain applications that, like GSS-API, put
non-standard data in the checksum field of the Authenticator in a
AP-REQ.

** Various minor bugfixes.

* Version 0.0.13 (released 2004-01-15)

** Fixed salt calculation in shisa.
The earlier salt computed was incorrect, so existing keys in your
Shisa database, that were derived from passwords, are incorrect, and
should be changed.

** Fixed shisa key file parser to handle keys with leading whitespace.
The parser used fscanf, which skip whitespace.  If your cryptographic
key (not passwords), in binary format, had leading whitespace, it
would fail to read the correct key.

** Fix shishid crash on startup when sockets can't be opened.

** Various minor bugfixes.

* Version 0.0.12 (released 2004-01-02)

** The user database library Shisa has been improved.
Shisa now support multiple keys for users, and you can now selectively
add and remove keys via the command line interface.

** The Shishi client and Shishid KDC now support TLS resumption.
This improve TLS handshake speed, in particular for the normal AS plus
TGS combination.  Currently the TLS resume database is only stored in
memory, so if either the client or server process is restarted, the
TLS resume information is lost.  This add --resume-limit to Shishid,
which can be used to specify the size of the TLS resume database (or
to disable it).

** The KDC has been cleaned up and the error handling is more robust.

** The Shisa programming API is documented in the manual.

* Version 0.0.11 (released 2003-12-21)

** The Shishi library now support X.509 authenticated KDC connections via TLS.
The client currently do not check server authentication, however this
is no worse than existing UDP/TCP connections.  If client certificates
are available, the X.509 client certificate is simply sent (via TLS
handshake) to the KDC for possible pre-authentication purposes.

** The KDC now support X.509 authentication.
If server certificates are available, X.509 authenticated TLS may be
negotiated.  The KDC currently only use the client certificate details
for logging purposes.  However, it do verify client certificate
against CA certificates, if those are available.

** The KDC has been cleaned up and the error handling is more robust.

* Version 0.0.10 (released 2003-12-16)

** The TLS support in Shishid now works.

** All command line interfaces now uses getopt instead of argp.

* Version 0.0.9 (released 2003-12-12)

** An information storage system added, called Shisa.
Shisa is used by KDCs (e.g., Shishid) to find information about
principals.  Shisa can be extended to support various backends, such
as LDAP and SQL databases, but currently only a file system based
database is supported.  Shisa consists of two parts, a library
(libshisa, see db/) and a command line tool (shisa, see src/).  Shisa
is designed to be concurrent write safe, i.e., multiple writers to the
same database is permitted.  This is very much work in progress.

** A new tool 'shisa' added to add/remove/list/modify the Shisa database.

** The Administration and Reference Manual has been (re)written.
There is now a step-by-step walk-through on creating the database for
a new realm, adding a few principals, starting the server and testing
it by getting tickets.

** Shishid (the KDC server) now read keys via the Shisa database.
The old hostkeys-alike file based "database" is no longer supported.

** A sample Shisa database and host keys are created during installation.
The default realm name (typically your hostname) is used, which might
not be what you prefer, but should get you started.

** Improve behaviour with poorly synchronized clocks.
Earlier newly acquired tickets were discarded if they were not yet
valid when you acquire them.  Now tickets are only discarded when
their end time is in the past.

** Support for DES and 3DES without integrity checking re-added.
Those encryption algorithms are needed by GSS Wrap/Unwrap, but was
accidently removed from Shishi during an earlier cleanup.

** When Libgcrypt is used, ARCFOUR now handle streamed operations.
This is needed for, e.g., rsh in the Shishi patched version of GNU
InetUtils.

** Paths to configurations files and host keys changed.
The configuration files and host keys are now stored (by default, but
see next entry) in $prefix/etc/shishi/, instead of, as it was before,
in $prefix/etc (for configuration and host keys) and
$prefix/share/shishi (for user configuration file template).

** Paths to configurations, host keys and the database root now configurable.
The configure parameters --with-conf-dir, --with-skel-dir,
--with-key-dir, and --with-db-dir can be used to specify the location
of shishi.conf and shisa.conf (system configuration files),
shishi.skel (user configuration file template), shishi.keys (host
specific keys) and the Shisa database root, respectively.

** IANA allocated Telnet Encrypt command 12 for the AES-CCM mode.

** Autoconf 2.59, Automake 1.8, and Libtool from CVS is used.

** Some more self tests were added.

* Version 0.0.8 (released 2003-10-16)

** Passwords are processed with SASLprep instead of KRBprep.

** Authorization improvements.

** Documentation additions.
Protocol descriptions for STARTTLS, AES-CCM encrypted telnet, and
Shishi rsh/rlogin.

** Support for upgrading TCP connections to KDC to TLS supported (STARTTLS).
STARTTLS support will be compiled in automatically, if you have GNUTLS
installed, but can be disabled unconditionally by configuring with
--disable-tls.  Use the 'realm-kdc' configuration token to specify
which KDCs the client should use it against, e.g.,
'realm-kdc=MYREALM.ORG,kdc.myrealm.org/tls'.

* Version 0.0.7 (released 2003-09-21)

** Encryption types can now be referred to using shorter aliases.
E.g., you can write "aes" instead of "aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96".

** ARCFOUR encryption support according to draft-brezak-win2k-krb-rc4-hmac-04.

** DES-CBC-CRC now works.

* Version 0.0.6 (released 2003-09-14)

** Proxiable, proxy, forwardable and forwarded tickets supported.
See the User Manual for discussion and examples.

** Man pages for all public functions are included.

** Installed versions of Libgcrypt and libtasn1 used where possible.
Shishi need Libgcrypt 1.1.44 or later, and libtasn1 0.2.5 or later.
If a usable version is not found, the internal Nettle (crypto/) and/or
libminitasn1 (asn1/) libraries are used instead.

** It is possible to enable and disable part of the system at compile time.
See --disable-des, --disable-3des, --disable-aes, --disable-md,
--disable-null, and --enable-arcfour.

** The internal crypto interface now fully modularized.
If you wish to add support for a new low-level cryptographic library,
to, e.g., utilize specialized hardware, it is now easy to do so.  Two
wrappers for Nettle (lib/nettle.c) and Libgcrypt (lib/libgcrypt.c) are
included.

** Logging destination for warnings and informational messages can be changed.
By default, message are sent to stderr for clients, and syslog for
servers.  See the new API functions shishi_outputtype and
shishi_set_outputtype for more information.

* Version 0.0.5 (released 2003-09-07)

** Server host name to realm mapping via DNS supported.

** SAFE functions improved.
Example code of a client using integrity protected application data
exchanges is in examples/client-safe.c and examples/server.c.

** PRIV functions added.
Example code of a client using privacy protected application data
exchanges is in examples/client-priv.c.

** Documentation improvements.
E.g., a reference manual was added, that document the configuration
file, and the shishi and shishid parameters.

** Various API changes.

* Version 0.0.4 (released 2003-08-31)

** The rsh/rlogin client 'rsh-redone' ported to Shishi, by Nicolas Pouvesle.
The client is located in extra/rsh-redone/.  It supports
authentication and encryption.  It interoperate with other
implementations.

** Authenticator subkeys are supported, and is used by default in AP/TGS.
Some KDCs does not understand subkeys in TGS requests, and use the
session key instead.  Shishi detect and work around this problem but
prints a warning.

** Simplistic key distribution center (KDC) is working.
See the Administration Manual for a walk through on how to get it up
and running.

** Various API changes.

* Version 0.0.3 (released 2003-08-22)

** Documentation fixes.

** Cleanups.

* Version 0.0.2 (released 2003-08-17)

** Command line handling of the 'shishi' application rewritten.
See the (updated) user manual and --help output for the new story.

** It is possible to acquire renewable tickets.

** Example client and server included.
Application data protection is not supported, but authentication is
demonstrated.  The files are in src/client.c and src/server.c.

** New configuration verbs: 'ticket-life' and 'renew-life'.

** AES ciphers didn't work when nettle was used.

** Cleanups, bug fixes and improved portability.

* Version 0.0.1 (released 2003-08-10)

** InetUtils copy removed.
The patches (also found in extra/inetutils.diff) are forwarded upstream.

** Libidn copy removed.
Libidn is optional, but recommended.  It is used automatically if
present on your system.

** Gettext not included.
Due to some conflicts between libtool and gettext, if you want i18n on
platforms that does not already have a useful gettext implementation,
you can install GNU gettext before building this package.  If you
don't care about i18n, this package should work fine (except for i18n,
of course).

** Low-level crypto uses nettle if libgcrypt is not installed.
Libgcrypt is not shipped with Shishi any more, instead a more
streamlined crypto implementation based on nettle is included.
Specify --with-libgcrypt to use libgcrypt.

** Libtasn1 updated and replaced by "minitasn1" from gnutls.
Specify --with-system-libtasn1 to link with the installed libtasn1, if
you have it.

** KDC addresses are now found via DNS SRV RRs as a last resort.
This is only enabled if libresolv and resolv.h is found on your
system.

** Argp and other compatibility files replaced by gl/ directory.

** Cleanups, bug fixes and various improvements.

* Version 0.0.0 (released 2003-06-02)

** Initial release
