Abstract

   This document describes an information model for Kerberos version 5
   from the point of view of an administrative service. There is no
   standard for administrating a kerberos 5 KDC. This document describes
   the services exposed by an administrative interface to a KDC.

2. Motivation

   The Kerberos version 5 authentication service described in [RFC1510]
   describes how a Key Distribution Service (KDC) provides
   authentication to clients. The standard does not stipulate how a KDC
   is managed and several "kadmin" servers have evolved. This document
   describes the services required to administrate a KDC and the
   underlying information model assumed by a kadmin service.

   The information model is written in terms of "attributes" and
   "services" or "interfaces" but the use of these particular words MUST
   NOT be taken to imply any particular modelling paradigm so that
   neither an object oriented model or an LDAP schema is intended. The
   author has attempted to describe in naturual language the intended
   semantics and syntax of the components of the model. An LDAP schema
   (say) based on this model will be more precise in the expression of
   the syntax while preserving the semantics of this model.

   Implementations of this document MAY decide to change the names used
   (eg principalName). If so an implementation MUST provide a name to
   name mapping to this document.

3. Information model

3.1 Principal

   The fundamental entity stored in a KDC is the principal. The
   principal is associated to keys and generalizes the "user" concept.

3.1.1 Attributes

3.1.1.1 principalName

   A principal MUST be uniquely identified withing the administrative
   context of the KDC by the principalName. The type of the
   principalName is not described in this document. It is a unique
   identifier and can be viewed as an opaque which can be compared for
   equality with.

3.1.2 Associations

   Each principal MUST be associated with exactly one KeySet.

3.1.3 Remarks

   Traditionally a principal consists of a local-part and a realm
   denoted in string form by local-part@REALM. The realm concept is used
   to provide administrative boundaries and together with cross-realm
   authentication provides scalability to Kerberos 5. However the realm
   is not central to an administrative information model. For instance
   the initialization or creation of a realm is equivalent to creating a
   specific set of principals (krbtgt@REALM, etc) which is covered by
   the model and services described in this document.

3.2 KeySet

   A KeySet is a set of keys associated with exactly one principal.

3.2.1 Attributes

3.2.1.1 Flags


3.2.2 Associations

   To each KeySet MUST be assocated a set of 1 or more Keys.

3.2.3 Remarks

   The reason for separating the KeySet from the Principal is security.

   The security of Kerberos 5 depends absolutely on the security of the
   keys stored in the KDC. The KeySet type is provided to make this
   clear and to make separation of keys from other parts of the model
   clear.

   Implementations of this standard (eg an LDAP schema) MUST preserve
   this distinction.

3.3 Key

3.3.1 Attributes

3.3.1.1 encryptionType

3.3.1.2 keyVersion

3.3.1.3 keyValue

3.3.1.4 saltType

3.3.1.5 saltValue

3.3.2 Associations

   None

3.3.3 Remarks

   The security of the keys is a requirement for the operation of
   Kerberos 5.

3.4 Policy

3.4.1 Attributes

3.4.2 Password Policy

3.4.2.1 Attributes

3.4.3 Key Policy

3.4.3.1 Attributes

4. Implementation Scenarios

   There are several ways to implement an administrative service for
   Kerberos 5 based on this information model. In this section we list a
   few of them.

4.1 LDAP backend to KDC

   Given an LDAP schema implementation of this information model it
   would be possible to build an administrative service by backending
   the KDC to a directory server where principals and keys are stored.
   Using the security mechanisms available on the directory server keys
   are protected from access by anyone apart from the KDC.
   Administration of the principals, policy and other non-key data is
   done through the directory server while the keys are modified using
   the set/change password protocol
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd].

4.2 LDAP frontend to KDC

   An alternative way to provide a directory interface to the KDC is to
   implement an LDAP-frontend to the KDC which exposes all non-key
   objects as entries and attributes. As in the example above all keys
   are modified using the set/change password protocol
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd]. In this scenario the
   implementation would typically not use a traditional LDAP
   implementation but treat LDAP as an access-protocol to data in the
   native KDC database.

5. Security Considerations

   This document describes an abstract information model for Kerberos 5.
   The Kerberos 5 protocol depends on the security of the keys stored in
   the KDC. The model described here assumes that keys MUST NOT be
   transported in the clear over the network and furthermore that keys
   are treated as write-only attributes that SHALL only be modified
   (using the administrative interface) by the change-password protocol
   [I-D.ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-set-passwd].
