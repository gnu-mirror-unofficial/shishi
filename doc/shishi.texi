@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Shishi is a (still incomplete) implementation of the Kerberos 5
network authentication system.  Shishi can be used to authenticate
users in distributed systems.

Shishi contains a library ('libshishi') that can be used by
application developers to add support for Kerberos 5.  Shishi contains
a command line utility ('shishi') that is used by users to acquire and
manage tickets (and more).  The server side, a Key Distribution
Center, is implemented by 'shishid'.  Of course, a manual documenting
usage aspects as well as the programming API is included.

Shishi currently supports AS/TGS exchanges for acquiring tickets, the
AP exchange for performing client and server authentication, and
SAFE/PRIV for integrity/privacy protected application data exchanges.

Shishi is internationalized; error and status messages can be
translated into the users' language; user name and passwords can be
converted into any available character set (normally including
ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8) and also be processed using an experimental
Stringprep profile.

Most, if not all, of the widely used encryption and checksum types are
supported, such as 3DES, AES and HMAC-SHA1.

Shishi is developed for the GNU/Linux system, but runs on over 20
platforms including most major Unix platforms and Windows, and many
kind of devices including iPAQ handhelds and S/390 mainframes.

Shishi is free software licensed under the GNU General Public License.

@node Getting Started
@section Getting Started

This manual documents the Shishi application and library programming
interface.  All commands, functions and data types provided by Shishi
are explained.

The reader is assumed to possess basic familiarity with network
security and the Kerberos 5 security system.

This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives a good introduction into the library and how it
can be used in an application.  Forward references are included where
necessary.  Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to
get just the information needed about any particular interface of the
library.  Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the
examples at the end of the manual, and then only read up those parts
of the interface which are unclear.

@node Features and Status
@section Features and Status

Shishi might have a couple of advantages over other packages doing a
similar job.

@table @asis
@item It's Free Software
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (@pxref{Copying}).

@item It's thread-safe
The library uses no global variables.

@item It's internationalized
It handles non-ASCII username and passwords and user visible strings
used in the library (error messages) can be translated into the users'
language.

@item It's portable
It should work on all Unix like operating systems, including Windows.

@end table

Shishi is far from feature complete, it is not even a full RFC 1510
implementation yet.  However, some basic functionality is implemented.
A few implemented feature are mentioned below.

@itemize @bullet

@item Initial authentication (AS) from raw key or password.
This step is typically used to acquire a ticket granting ticket and,
less commonly, a server ticket.

@item Subsequent authentication (TGS).
This step is typically used to acquire a server ticket, by
authenticating yourself using the ticket granting ticket.

@item Client-Server authentication (AP).
This step is used by clients and servers to prove to each other who
they are, using negotiated tickets.

@item Integrity protected communication (SAFE).
This step is used by clients and servers to exchange integrity
protected data with each other.  The key is typically agreed on using
the Client-Server authentication step.

@item Ticket cache, supporting multiple principals and realms.
As tickets have a life time of typically several hours, they are
managed in disk files.  There can be multiple ticket caches, and each
ticket cache can store tickets for multiple clients (users), servers,
encryption types, etc.  Functionality is provided for locating the
proper ticket for every use.

@item Most standard cryptographic primitives.
The believed most secure algorithms are supported
(@pxref{Cryptographic Overview}).

@item Telnet client and server.
This is used to remotely login to other machines, after authenticating
yourself with a ticket.

@item PAM module.
This is used to login locally on a machine.

@item KDC addresses located using DNS SRV RRs.

@item Modularized low-level crypto interface.
Currently Nettle and Libgcrypt are supported.  If you wish to add
support for another low-level cryptographic library, you only have to
implement a few APIs to DES, AES, MD5, SHA1, HMAC, etc, look at
@file{lib/nettle.c} or @file{lib/libgcrypt.c} as a starting pointer.

@end itemize

The following table summarize what the current objectives are (i.e.,
the todo list) and an estimate on how long it will take to implement
the feature.  If you like to start working on anything, please let me
know so work duplication can be avoided.

@itemize @bullet

@item Pre-authentication support (week).

@item Cross-realm support (week).

@item PKINIT (use libksba, weeks)

@item Finish GSSAPI support via GSSLib (weeks)
Shishi will not support GSSLib natively, but a separate project
``GSSLib'' is under way to produce a generic GSS implementation, and
it will use Shishi to implement the Kerberos 5 mechanism.

@item Port to cyclone (cyclone need to mature first)

@item Modularize ASN.1 library so it can be replaced (days).
Almost done, all ASN.1 functionality is found in lib/asn1.c, although
the interface is rather libtasn1 centric.

@item KDC (initiated, weeks)

@item LDAP backend for Shisa.

@item Set/Change password protocol (weeks?)

@item Port applications to use Shishi (indefinite)

@item Improve documentation

@item Improve internationalization

@item Add AP-REQ replay cache (week).

@item Study benefits by introducing a PA-TGS-REP.
This would provide mutual authentication of the KDC in a way that is
easier to analyze.  Currently the mutual authentication property is
only implicit from successful decryption of the KDC-REP and the 4 byte
nonce.

@item GUI applet for managing tickets.
This is supported via the ticket-applet, of which a Shishi port is
published on the Shishi home page.

@item Authorization library (months?)
The shishi_authorized_p() is not a good solution, better would be to
have a generic and flexible authorization library.  Possibly based on
S-EXP's in tickets?  Should support non-Kerberos uses as well, of
course.

@node Overview
@section Overview

This section describes RFC 1510 from a protocol point of
view@footnote{The text is a lightly adapted version of the
introduction section from RFC 1510 by J. Kohl and C. Neuman, September
1993, unclear copyrights, but presumably owned by The Internet
Society.}.

Kerberos provides a means of verifying the identities of principals,
(e.g., a workstation user or a network server) on an open
(unprotected) network.  This is accomplished without relying on
authentication by the host operating system, without basing trust on
host addresses, without requiring physical security of all the hosts
on the network, and under the assumption that packets traveling along
the network can be read, modified, and inserted at will. (Note,
however, that many applications use Kerberos' functions only upon the
initiation of a stream-based network connection, and assume the
absence of any "hijackers" who might subvert such a connection.  Such
use implicitly trusts the host addresses involved.)  Kerberos performs
authentication under these conditions as a trusted third- party
authentication service by using conventional cryptography, i.e.,
shared secret key.  (shared secret key - Secret and private are often
used interchangeably in the literature.  In our usage, it takes two
(or more) to share a secret, thus a shared DES key is a secret key.
Something is only private when no one but its owner knows it.  Thus,
in public key cryptosystems, one has a public and a private key.)

The authentication process proceeds as follows: A client sends a
request to the authentication server (AS) requesting "credentials" for
a given server.  The AS responds with these credentials, encrypted in
the client's key.  The credentials consist of 1) a "ticket" for the
server and 2) a temporary encryption key (often called a "session
key").  The client transmits the ticket (which contains the client's
identity and a copy of the session key, all encrypted in the server's
key) to the server.  The session key (now shared by the client and
server) is used to authenticate the client, and may optionally be used
to authenticate the server.  It may also be used to encrypt further
communication between the two parties or to exchange a separate
sub-session key to be used to encrypt further communication.

The implementation consists of one or more authentication servers
running on physically secure hosts.  The authentication servers
maintain a database of principals (i.e., users and servers) and their
secret keys. Code libraries provide encryption and implement the
Kerberos protocol.  In order to add authentication to its
transactions, a typical network application adds one or two calls to
the Kerberos library, which results in the transmission of the
necessary messages to achieve authentication.

The Kerberos protocol consists of several sub-protocols (or
exchanges).  There are two methods by which a client can ask a
Kerberos server for credentials.  In the first approach, the client
sends a cleartext request for a ticket for the desired server to the
AS. The reply is sent encrypted in the client's secret key. Usually
this request is for a ticket-granting ticket (TGT) which can later be
used with the ticket-granting server (TGS).  In the second method, the
client sends a request to the TGS.  The client sends the TGT to the
TGS in the same manner as if it were contacting any other application
server which requires Kerberos credentials.  The reply is encrypted in
the session key from the TGT.

Once obtained, credentials may be used to verify the identity of the
principals in a transaction, to ensure the integrity of messages
exchanged between them, or to preserve privacy of the messages.  The
application is free to choose whatever protection may be necessary.

To verify the identities of the principals in a transaction, the
client transmits the ticket to the server.  Since the ticket is sent
"in the clear" (parts of it are encrypted, but this encryption doesn't
thwart replay) and might be intercepted and reused by an attacker,
additional information is sent to prove that the message was
originated by the principal to whom the ticket was issued.  This
information (called the authenticator) is encrypted in the session
key, and includes a timestamp.  The timestamp proves that the message
was recently generated and is not a replay.  Encrypting the
authenticator in the session key proves that it was generated by a
party possessing the session key.  Since no one except the requesting
principal and the server know the session key (it is never sent over
the network in the clear) this guarantees the identity of the client.

The integrity of the messages exchanged between principals can also be
guaranteed using the session key (passed in the ticket and contained
in the credentials).  This approach provides detection of both replay
attacks and message stream modification attacks.  It is accomplished
by generating and transmitting a collision-proof checksum (elsewhere
called a hash or digest function) of the client's message, keyed with
the session key.  Privacy and integrity of the messages exchanged
between principals can be secured by encrypting the data to be passed
using the session key passed in the ticket, and contained in the
credentials.

@node Cryptographic Overview
@section Cryptographic Overview

Shishi implements several of the standard cryptographic primitives.
In this section we give the names of the supported encryption suites,
and some notes about them, and their associated checksum suite.

Statements such as ``it is weak'' should be read as meaning that there
is no credible security analysis of the mechanism available, and/or
that should an attack be published publicly, few people would likely
be surprised.  Also keep in mind that the key size mentioned is the
actual key size, not the effective key space as far as a brute force
attack is concerned.

@cindex DES
@cindex 3DES
@cindex AES
@cindex ARCFOUR

@table @code

@item NULL

@code{NULL} is a dummy encryption suite for debugging.  Encryption and
decryption are identity functions.  No integrity protection.  It is
weak.  It is associated with the @code{NULL} checksum.

@item arcfour-hmac
@itemx arcfour-hmac-exp

@code{arcfour-hmac-*} are a proprietary stream cipher with 56 bit
(@code{arcfour-hmac-exp}) or 128 bit (@code{arcfour-hmac}) keys, used
in a proprietary way described in an expired IETF draft
@file{draft-brezak-win2k-krb-rc4-hmac-04.txt}.  Deriving keys from
passwords is supported, and is done by computing a message digest
(MD4) of a 16-bit Unicode representation of the ASCII password, with
no salt.  Data is integrity protected with a keyed hash (HMAC-MD5),
where the key is derived from the base key in a creative way.  It is
weak.  It is associated with the @code{arcfour-hmac-md5} checksum.

@item des-cbc-crc

@code{des-cbc-crc} is DES encryption and decryption with 56 bit keys
and 8 byte blocks in CBC mode, using the key as IV. The keys can be
derived from passwords by an obscure application specific
algorithm. Data is integrity protected with an unkeyed but encrypted
@code{CRC32}-like checksum.  It is weak. It is associated with the
@code{rsa-md5-des} checksum.

@item des-cbc-md4

@code{des-cbc-md4} is DES encryption and decryption with 56 bit keys
and 8 byte blocks in CBC mode, using a zero IV. The keys can be
derived from passwords by an obscure application specific
algorithm. Data is integrity protected with an unkeyed but encrypted
MD4 hash.  It is weak. It is associated with the @code{rsa-md4-des}
checksum.

@item des-cbc-md5

@code{des-cbc-md5} is DES encryption and decryption with 56 bit keys
and 8 byte blocks in CBC mode, using a zero IV.  The keys can be
derived from passwords by an obscure application specific
algorithm. Data is integrity protected with an unkeyed but encrypted
MD5 hash.  It is weak.  It is associated with the @code{rsa-md5-des}
checksum.  This is the strongest RFC 1510 interoperable encryption
mechanism.

@item des3-cbc-sha1-kd

@code{des3-cbc-sha1-kd} is DES encryption and decryption with three 56
bit keys (effective key size 112 bits) and 8 byte blocks in CBC
mode. The keys can be derived from passwords by a algorithm based on
the paper "A Better Key Schedule For DES-like Ciphers"
@footnote{@url{http://www.research.att.com/~smb/papers/ides.pdf}} by
Uri Blumenthal and Steven M. Bellovin (it is not clear if the
algorithm, and the way it is used, is used by any other protocols,
although it seems unlikely).  Data is integrity protected with a keyed
SHA1 hash in HMAC mode.  It has no security proof, but is assumed to
provide adequate security in the sense that knowledge on how to crack
it is not known to the public.  Note that the key derivation function
is not widely used outside of Kerberos, hence not widely studied.  It
is associated with the @code{hmac-sha1-des3-kd} checksum.

@item aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96
@itemx aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96

@code{aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96} and @code{aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96} is
AES encryption and decryption with 128 bit and 256 bit key,
respectively, and 16 byte blocks in CBC mode with Cipher Text
Stealing.  Cipher Text Stealing means data length of encrypted data is
preserved (pure CBC add up to 7 pad characters).  The keys can be
derived from passwords with RSA Laboratories PKCS#5 Password Based Key
Derivation Function
2@footnote{@url{http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/pkcs/pkcs-5/}},
which is allegedly provably secure in a random oracle model.  Data is
integrity protected with a keyed SHA1 hash, in HMAC mode, truncated to
96 bits.  There is no security proof, but the schemes are assumed to
provide adequate security in the sense that knowledge on how to crack
them is not known to the public.  Note that AES has yet to receive the
test of time, and the CBC variation used is not widely standardized
(hence not widely studied).  It is associated with the
@code{hmac-sha1-96-aes128} and @code{hmac-sha1-96-aes256} checksums,
respectively.

@end table

The protocol do not include any way to negotiate which checksum
mechanisms to use, so in most cases the associated checksum will be
used.  However, checksum mechanisms can be used with other encryption
mechanisms, as long as they are compatible in terms of key format etc.
Here are the names of the supported checksum mechanisms, with some
notes on their status and the compatible encryption mechanisms. They
are ordered by increased security as perceived by the author.

@table @code

@item NULL

@code{NULL} is a dummy checksum suite for debugging.  It provides no
integrity.  It is weak.  It is compatible with the @code{NULL}
encryption mechanism.

@item arcfour-hmac-md5

@code{arcfour-hmac-md5} is a keyed HMAC-MD5 checksum computed on a MD5
message digest, in turn computed on a four byte message type indicator
concatenated with the application data.  (The @code{arcfour}
designation is thus somewhat misleading, but since this checksum
mechanism is described in the same document as the @code{arcfour}
encryption mechanisms, it is not a completely unnatural designation.)
It is weak.  It is compatible with all encryption mechanisms.

@item rsa-md4

@code{rsa-md4} is a unkeyed MD4 hash computed over the message.  Since
it is unkeyed, it is in general a weak checksum, however applications
can, with care, use it non-weak ways (e.g., by including the hash in
other messages that are encrypted or checksummed).  It is compatible
with all encryption mechanisms.

@item rsa-md4-des

@code{rsa-md4-des} is a DES CBC encryption of one block of random data
and a unkeyed MD4 hash computed over the random data and the message
to integrity protect.  The key used is derived from the base protocol
key by XOR with a constant.  It is weak. It is compatible with the
@code{des-cbc-crc}, @code{des-cbc-md4}, @code{des-cbc-md5} encryption
mechanisms.

@item rsa-md5

@code{rsa-md5} is a unkeyed MD5 hash computed over the message.  Since
it is unkeyed, it is in general a weak checksum, however applications
can, with care, use it non-weak ways (e.g., by including the hash in
other messages that are encrypted or checksummed).  It is compatible
with all encryption mechanisms.

@item rsa-md5-des

@code{rsa-md5-des} is a DES CBC encryption of one block of random data
and a unkeyed MD5 hash computed over the random data and the message
to integrity protect.  The key used is derived from the base protocol
key by XOR with a constant.  It is weak.  It is compatible with the
@code{des-cbc-crc}, @code{des-cbc-md4}, @code{des-cbc-md5} encryption
mechanisms.

@item hmac-sha1-des3-kd

@code{hmac-sha1-des3-kd} is a keyed SHA1 hash in HMAC mode computed
over the message.  The key is derived from the base protocol by the
simplified key derivation function (similar to the password key
derivation functions of @code{des3-cbc-sha1-kd}).  It has no security
proof, but is assumed to provide good security, if the key derivation
function is good.  It is compatible with the @code{des3-cbc-sha1-kd}
encryption mechanism.

@item hmac-sha1-96-aes128
@itemx hmac-sha1-96-aes256

@code{hmac-sha1-96-aes*} are keyed SHA1 hashes in HMAC mode computed
over the message and then truncated to 96 bits.  The key is derived
from the base protocol by the simplified key derivation function
(similar to the password key derivation functions of
@code{des3-cbc-sha1-kd}).  It has no security proof, but is assumed to
provide good security, if the key derivation function is good.  It is
compatible with the @code{aes*-cts-hmac-sha1-96} encryption
mechanisms.

@cindex Download

The package can be downloaded from several places, including
@url{http://josefsson.org/shishi/releases/}.  The latest version is
stored in a file, e.g., @samp{shishi-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz} where the
@samp{@value{VERSION}} indicate the highest version number.

The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring
and building it, refer to the @file{INSTALL} file that is part of the
distribution archive.

Here is an example terminal session that download, configure, build
and install the package.  You will need a few basic tools, such as
@samp{sh}, @samp{make} and @samp{cc}.

@example
$ wget -q http://josefsson.org/shishi/releases/shishi-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ tar xfz shishi-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
$ cd shishi-@value{VERSION}/
$ ./configure
...
$ make
...
$ make install
...
@end example

After this you should be prepared to continue with the user,
administration or programming manual, depending on how you want to use
Shishi.

A few @code{configure} options may be relevant, summarized in the
table.

@table @code

@item --disable-des
@itemx --disable-3des
@itemx --disable-aes
@itemx --disable-md
@itemx --disable-null
@itemx --disable-arcfour
Disable a cryptographic algorithm at compile time.  Usually it is
better to disable algorithms during run-time with the configuration
file, but this allows you to reduce the code size slightly.

@item --disable-starttls
Disable the experimental TLS support for KDC connections.  If you do
not use a Shishi KDC, this support is of no use so you could safely
disable it.

@item --without-stringprep
Disable internationalized string processing.

@end table

For the complete list, refer to the output from @code{configure

If you think you have found a bug in Shishi, please investigate it and
report it.

@itemize @bullet

@item Please make sure that the bug is really in Shishi, and
preferably also check that it hasn't already been fixed in the latest
version.

@item You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
reproduce the bug.

@item You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or
if the results printed are not good and in that case, in what way.
Make sure that the bug report includes all information you would need
to fix this kind of bug for someone else.

@end itemize

Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with
something definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or
piecemeal messages are difficult to act on and don't help the
development effort.

If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the software; if the bug report is poor, we won't
do anything about it (apart from asking you to send better bug
reports).

If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright

If you want to submit a patch for inclusion -- from solve a typo you
discovered, up to adding support for a new feature -- you should
submit it as a bug report (@pxref{Bug Reports}).  There are some
things that you can do to increase the chances for it to be included
in the official package.

Unless your patch is very small (say, under 10 lines) we require that
you assign the copyright of your work to the Free Software Foundation.
This is to protect the freedom of the project.  If you have not
already signed papers, we will send you the necessary information when
you submit your contribution.

For contributions that doesn't consist of actual programming code, the
only guidelines are common sense.  Use it.

For code contributions, a number of style guides will help you:

@itemize @bullet

@item Coding Style.
Follow the GNU Standards document (@pxref{top, GNU Coding Standards,,
standards}).

If you normally code using another coding standard, there is no
problem, but you should use @samp{indent} to reformat the code
(@pxref{top, GNU Indent,, indent}) before submitting your work.

@item Use the unified diff format @samp{diff -u}.

@item Return errors.
The only valid reason for ever aborting the execution of the program
is due to memory allocation errors, but for that you should call
@samp{xalloc_die} to allow the application to recover if it wants to.

@item Design with thread safety in mind.
Don't use global variables.  Don't even write to per-handle global
variables unless the documented behaviour of the function you write is
to write to the per-handle global variable.

@item Avoid using the C math library.
It causes problems for embedded implementations, and in most
situations it is very easy to avoid using it.

@item Document your functions.
Use comments before each function headers, that, if properly
formatted, are extracted into Texinfo manuals and GTK-DOC web pages.

@item Supply a ChangeLog and NEWS entries, where appropriate.

@cindex End-user Shishi usage

Usually Shishi interacts with you to get some initial authentication
information like a password, and then contacts a server to receive a
so called ticket granting ticket.  From now on, you rarely interacts
with Shishi directly.  Applications that needs security services
instruct the Shishi library to use the ticket granting ticket to get
new tickets for various servers.  An example could be if you log on to
a host remotely via @samp{telnet}.  The host usually requires
authentication before permitting you in.  The @samp{telnet} client
uses the ticket granting ticket to get a ticket for the server, and
then use this ticket to authenticate you against the server (typically
the server is also authenticated to you).  You perform the initial
authentication by typing @command{shishi} at the prompt.  Sometimes it
is necessary to supply options telling Shishi what your principal name
(user name in the Kerberos realm) or realm is.  In the example, I
specify the client name @code{simon@@JOSEFSSON.ORG}.

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi simon@@JOSEFSSON.ORG
Enter password for `simon@@JOSEFSSON.ORG':
simon@@JOSEFSSON.ORG:
Authtime:       Fri Aug 15 04:44:49 2003
Endtime:        Fri Aug 15 05:01:29 2003
Server:         krbtgt/JOSEFSSON.ORG key des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16)
Ticket key:     des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16) protected by des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16)
Ticket flags:   INITIAL (512)
$ 
@end example
@end cartouche

As you can see, Shishi also prints a short description of the ticket
received.

A logical next step is to display all tickets you have received (by
the way, the tickets are usually stored as text in
@file{~/.shishi/tickets}).  This is achieved by typing @command{shishi
--list}.

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi --list
Tickets in `/home/jas/.shishi/tickets':

2 tickets found.
$
@end example
@end cartouche

As you can see, I had a ticket for the server
@samp{host/latte.josefsson.org} which was generated by
@samp{telnet}:ing to that host.

If, for some reason, you want to manually get a ticket for a specific
server, you can use the @command{shishi --server-name} command.
Normally, however, the application that uses Shishi will take care of
getting a ticket for the appropriate server, so you normally wouldn't
need this command.

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi --server-name=user/billg --encryption-type=des-cbc-md4
jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG:
Authtime:       Fri Aug 15 04:49:46 2003
Starttime:      Fri Aug 15 04:54:33 2003
Endtime:        Fri Aug 15 05:06:26 2003
Server:         user/billg key des-cbc-md4 (2)
Ticket key:     des-cbc-md4 (2) protected by des-cbc-md5 (3)
$
@end example
@end cartouche

As you can see, I acquired a ticket for @samp{user/billg} with a
@samp{des-cbc-md4} (@pxref{Cryptographic Overview}) encryption key
specified with the @samp{--encryption-type} parameter.

To wrap up this introduction, lets see how you can remove tickets.
You may want to do this if you leave your terminal for lunch or
similar, and don't want someone to be able to copy the file and then
use your credentials.  Note that this only destroy the tickets
locally, it does not contact any server and tell it that these
credentials are no longer valid.  So if someone stole your ticket
file, you must contact your administrator and have them reset your
account, simply using this parameter is not sufficient.

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi --server-name=imap/latte.josefsson.org --destroy
1 ticket removed.
$ shishi --server-name=foobar --destroy
No tickets removed.
$ shishi --destroy
3 tickets removed.
$
@end example
@end cartouche

Since the @samp{--server-name} parameter takes a long to type, it is
possible to type the server name directly, after the client name.  The
following example demonstrate a AS-REQ followed by a TGS-REQ for a
specific server (assuming you did not have any tickets from the
start).

@cartouche
@example
$ src/shishi simon@@latte.josefsson.org imap/latte.josefsson.org
Enter password for `simon@@latte.josefsson.org':
simon@@latte.josefsson.org:

$
@end example
@end cartouche

Refer to the reference manual for all available parameters
(@pxref{Parameters for shishi}).  The rest of this section contains
description of more specialized usage modes that can be ignored by
most users.

@section Proxiable and Proxy Tickets

At times it may be necessary for a principal to allow a service to
perform an operation on its behalf. The service must be able to take
on the identity of the client, but only for a particular purpose. A
principal can allow a service to take on the principal's identity for
a particular purpose by granting it a proxy.

The process of granting a proxy using the proxy and proxiable flags is
used to provide credentials for use with specific services. Though
conceptually also a proxy, users wishing to delegate their identity in
a form usable for all purpose MUST use the ticket forwarding mechanism
described in the next section to forward a ticket-granting ticket.

The PROXIABLE flag in a ticket is normally only interpreted by the
ticket-granting service. It can be ignored by application servers.
When set, this flag tells the ticket-granting server that it is OK to
issue a new ticket (but not a ticket-granting ticket) with a different
network address based on this ticket. This flag is set if requested by
the client on initial authentication. By default, the client will
request that it be set when requesting a ticket-granting ticket, and
reset when requesting any other ticket.

This flag allows a client to pass a proxy to a server to perform a
remote request on its behalf (e.g. a print service client can give the
print server a proxy to access the client's files on a particular file
server in order to satisfy a print request).

In order to complicate the use of stolen credentials, Kerberos tickets
are usually valid from only those network addresses specifically
included in the ticket[4]. When granting a proxy, the client MUST
specify the new network address from which the proxy is to be used, or
indicate that the proxy is to be issued for use from any address.

The PROXY flag is set in a ticket by the TGS when it issues a proxy
ticket.  Application servers MAY check this flag and at their option
they MAY require additional authentication from the agent presenting
the proxy in order to provide an audit trail.

Here is how you would acquire a PROXY ticket for the service
@samp{imap/latte.josefsson.org}:

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG imap/latte.josefsson.org --proxy
Enter password for `jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG':
libshishi: warning: KDC bug: Reply encrypted using wrong key.
jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG:

Ticket key:     des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16) protected by des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16)
Ticket flags:   PROXY (16)
$
@end example
@end cartouche

As you noticed, this asked for your password.  The reason is that
proxy tickets must be acquired using a proxiable ticket granting
ticket, which was not present.  If you often need to get proxy
tickets, you may acquire a proxiable ticket granting ticket from the
start:

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi --proxiable
Enter password for `jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG':
jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG:
Authtime:       Mon Sep  8 20:04:27 2003
Endtime:        Tue Sep  9 04:04:27 2003

Ticket key:     des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16) protected by des3-cbc-sha1-kd (16)
Ticket flags:   PROXIABLE INITIAL (520)
@end example
@end cartouche

Then you should be able to acquire proxy tickets based on that ticket
granting ticket, as follows:

@cartouche
@example

Ticket flags:   PROXY (16)
$
@end example
@end cartouche

@section Forwardable and Forwarded Tickets

Authentication forwarding is an instance of a proxy where the service
that is granted is complete use of the client's identity. An example
where it might be used is when a user logs in to a remote system and
wants authentication to work from that system as if the login were
local.

The FORWARDABLE flag in a ticket is normally only interpreted by the
ticket-granting service. It can be ignored by application servers.
The FORWARDABLE flag has an interpretation similar to that of the
PROXIABLE flag, except ticket-granting tickets may also be issued with
different network addresses. This flag is reset by default, but users
MAY request that it be set by setting the FORWARDABLE option in the AS
request when they request their initial ticket-granting ticket.

This flag allows for authentication forwarding without requiring the
user to enter a password again. If the flag is not set, then
authentication forwarding is not permitted, but the same result can
still be achieved if the user engages in the AS exchange specifying
the requested network addresses and supplies a password.

The FORWARDED flag is set by the TGS when a client presents a ticket
with the FORWARDABLE flag set and requests a forwarded ticket by
specifying the FORWARDED KDC option and supplying a set of addresses
for the new ticket. It is also set in all tickets issued based on
tickets with the FORWARDED flag set. Application servers may choose to
process FORWARDED tickets differently than non-FORWARDED tickets.

If addressless tickets are forwarded from one system to another,
clients SHOULD still use this option to obtain a new TGT in order to
have different session keys on the different systems.

Here is how you would acquire a FORWARDED ticket for the service
@samp{host/latte.josefsson.org}:

@cartouche
@example
$ shishi jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG host/latte.josefsson.org --forwarded
Enter password for `jas@@JOSEFSSON.ORG':

Ticket flags:   FORWARDED (4)
$
@end example
@end cartouche

As you noticed, this asked for your password.  The reason is that
forwarded tickets must be acquired using a forwardable ticket granting
ticket, which was not present.  If you often need to get forwarded
tickets, you may acquire a forwardable ticket granting ticket from the
start:

Here you will learn how to set up, run and maintain the Shishi
Kerberos server.  Kerberos is incompatible with the standard Unix
@file{/etc/passwd} password database@footnote{And besides, Shishi is
intended to work on non-Unix platforms as well.}, therefor the first
step will be to create a Kerberos user database.  Shishi's user
database system is called Shisa.  Once Shisa is configured, you can
then start the server and begin issuing Kerberos tickets to your
users.  The Shishi server is called @file{shishid}.  After getting the
server up and running, we discuss how you can set up multiple Kerberos
servers, to increase availability or offer load-balancing.  Finally,
we include some information intended for developers, that will enable
you to customize Shisa to use an external user database, such as a
@acronym{LDAP} server or @acronym{SQL} database.

@node Introduction to Shisa
@section Introduction to Shisa

The user database part of Shishi is called Shisa.  The Shisa library
is independent of the core Shishi library.  Shisa is responsible for
storing the name of your realms, the name of your principals (users),
accounting information for the users (i.e., when each account start to
be valid and when it expire), and the cryptographic keys each user
have.  Some Kerberos internal data can also be stored, such as the key
version number, the last dates for when various ticket requests were
made, the cryptographic salt, string-to-key parameters and password
for each user.  Not all information need to be stored.  For example,
in some situations it is prudent to leave the password field empty, so
that somebody who manage to steal the user database will only be able
to compromise your system, and not other systems were your user may
have re-used the same password.  On the other hand, you may already
store the password in your customized database, in which case being
able to change it via the Shisa interface can be useful.

Shisa is a small (a few thousand lines of C code) standalone library.
Shisa does not depend on the Shishi library.  Because a user database
with passwords may be useful for other applications as well (e.g.,
@acronym{GNU} @acronym{SASL}), it may be separated into its own
project later on.  You should keep this in mind, so that you don't
consider writing a Shisa backend for your own database a purely Shishi
specific project.  You may, for example, chose to use the Shisa
interface in your own applications to have a simple interface to your
user database.  Your experience and feedback is appreciated if you
chose to explore this.

Note that the Shisa database does not expose everything you may want
to know about a user, such as its full human name, telephone number or
even the user's login account name or home directory.  It only store
what is needed to authenticate a peer claiming to be an entity.  Thus
it does not make sense to replace your current user database or
@file{/etc/passwd} with data derived from the Shisa database.
Instead, it is intended that you write a Shisa backend that export
@i{some} of the information stored in your user database.  You may be
able to replace some existing functionality, such as the password
field in @file{/etc/passwd} with a Kerberos PAM module, but there is
no requirement for doing so.

@node Configuring Shisa
@section Configuring Shisa

The configuration file for Shisa is typically stored in
@file{/usr/local/etc/shishi/shisa.conf}.  You do not have to configure
this file, the defaults should be acceptable to first-time users.  The
file is used to define where you user database reside, and some
options such as making the database read-only or whether errors
detected when accessing the database should be ignored.  (The latter
may be useful if the server is a remote @acronym{LDAP} server that may
be unavailable, and you want to fail over to a local copy of the
database.)

The default will store the user database using directories and files,
rooted by default in @file{/usr/local/var/shishi}.  You may use
standard file permission settings to control access to the directory
hierarchy.  It is strongly recommended to restrict access to the
directory.  Storing the directory on local storage (i.e., hard disk or
removal media) is recommended.  We discourage placing the database on
a network file system, but realize it can be useful in some situations
(@pxref{Multiple servers}).

See the reference manual (@pxref{Shisa Configuration}) for the details
of the configuration file.  Again, you are not expected to need to
modify anything unless you are an experienced Shishi administrator.

@node Using Shisa
@section Using Shisa

There is a command line interface to the Shisa library, aptly named
@file{shisa}.  You will use this tool to add, remove and change
information stored in the database about realms, principals and keys.
The tool can also be used to ``dump'' all information in the database,
for backup or debugging purposes.  (Currently the output format cannot
be read by any tool, but functionality to do this will be added in the
future, possibly as a read-only file-based Shisa database backend.)

The reference manual (@pxref{Parameters for shisa}) explains all
parameters, but here we will give you a walk-through of the typical
uses of the tool.

Installing Shishi usually create a realm with two principals; one
ticket granting ticket for the realm, and one host key for the server.
This is what you typically need to get started, but it doesn't serve
our purposes.  So we start by removing the principals and the realm.
To do that, we need to figure out the name of the realm.  The
@samp{--list} or @samp{--dump} parameters can be used for this.  (Most
``long'' parameters, like @samp{--dump}, have shorter names as well,
in this case @samp{-d}, @ref{Parameters for shisa}).

@example
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ shisa -d
latte
        krbtgt/latte
                Account is enabled.
                Current key version 0 (0x0).
        host/latte
                Account is enabled.
                Current key version 0 (0x0).
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$
@end example

The realm names are printed at column 0, the principal names are
indented with one @samp{TAB} character (aka @samp{\t} or ASCII 0x09
Horizontal Tabulation), and the information about each principal are
indented with two @samp{TAB} characters.  The above output means that
there is one realm @samp{latte} with two principals; @samp{krbtgt} and
@samp{admin}.

If the installation did not create a default database for you, you
might get an error similar to the following.

@example
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ shisa -l
shisa: Cannot initialize `file' database backend.
Location `/usr/local/var/shishi' and options `N/A'.
shisa: Initialization failed:
Shisa database could not be opened.
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$
@end example

This indicate the database do not exist.  For a file database, you can
create it by simply creating the directory, as follows.  Note the
access permission change with @samp{chmod}.  Typically the @samp{root}
user would own the files, but as these examples demonstrate, setting
up a Kerberos server does not require root access.  Indeed, it may be
prudent to run all Shishi applications as a special non-@samp{root}
user, and have all Shishi related files owned by that user, so that
any security vulnerabilities does not lead to a system compromise.
(However, if the user database is lost, system compromises of other
systems may be possible if you use, e.g., Kerberos Telnet.)

@example
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ rmdir /usr/local/var/shishi
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ mkdir /usr/local/var/shishi
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ chmod 0700 /usr/local/var/shishi
@end example

Back to the first example, where you have a realm @samp{latte} with
some principals.  We want to remove the realm to demonstrate how you
create the realm from scratch.  (Of course, you can have more than one
realm in the database, but for this example we assume you want to set
up a realm named the same as Shishi guessed you would name it, so the
existing realm need to be removed first.)  The @samp{--remove} (short
form @samp{-r}) parameter is used for this purpose, as follows.

@example
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ shisa -r latte host/latte
Removing principal `host/latte@@latte'...
Removing principal `host/latte@@latte'...done
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ shisa -r latte krbtgt/latte
Removing principal `krbtgt/latte@@latte'...
Removing principal `krbtgt/latte@@latte'...done
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ shisa -r latte
Removing realm `latte'...
Removing realm `latte'...done
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$
@end example

You may be asking yourself ``What if the realm has many more
principals?''.  If you fear manual labor (or a small @samp{sed}
script, recall the format of @samp{--list}?), don't worry, there is a
@samp{--force} (short form @samp{-f}) flag.  Here is a faster way to
do the above:

@example
jas@@latte:~/src/shishi$ shisa -r latte -f
Removing principal `krbtgt/latte@@latte'...
Removing principal `krbtgt/latte@@latte'...done
Removing principal `host/latte@@latte'...
Removing principal `host/latte@@latte'...done
Removing realm `latte'...
Removing realm `latte'...done

@node Multiple servers
@section Multiple servers
@cindex remote databases
@cindex LDAP
@cindex SQL

@cindex NFS
@cindex IPSEC
@cindex rsync
Setting up multiple servers is as easy as replicating the user
database.  Since the default @samp{file} user database is stored in
the normal file system, you can use any common tools to replicate a
file system.  Network file system like @acronym{NFS} (properly secured
by, e.g., a point-to-point symmetrically encrypted @acronym{IPSEC}
connection) and file synchronizing tools like @samp{rsync} are typical
choices.

@cindex master server
@cindex secondary server
The secondary server should be configured just like the master server.
If you use the @samp{file} database over @acronym{NFS} you do not have
to make any modifications.  If you use, e.g., a cron job to
@samp{rsync} the directory every hour or so, you may want to add a
@samp{--read-only} flag to the Shisa @samp{db} definition
(@pxref{Shisa Configuration}).  That way, nobody will be lured into
creating or changing information in the database on the secondary
server, which only would be overwritten during the next
synchronization.

@example
db --read-only file /usr/local/var/backup-shishi
@end example

@cindex concurrent writers
The @samp{file} database is designed so it doesn't require file
locking in the file system, which may be unreliable in some network
file systems or implementations.  It is also designed so that multiple
concurrent readers and writers may access the database without causing
corruption.

@strong{Warning:} The last paragraph is currently not completely
accurate.  There may be race conditions with concurrent writers.  None
should cause infinite loops or data loss.  However, unexpected results
might occur if two writers try to update information about a principal
simultaneous.

If you use a remote @acronym{LDAP} server or @acronym{SQL} database to
store the user database, and access it via a Shisa backend, you have
make sure your Shisa backend handle concurrent writers properly.  If
you use a modern @acronym{SQL} database, this probably is not a
concern.  If it is a problem, you may be able to work around it by
implementing some kind of synchronization or semaphore mechanism.  If
all else sounds too complicated, you can set up the secondary servers
as @samp{--read-only} servers, although you will lose some
functionality (like changing passwords via the secondary server, or
updating timestamps when the last ticket request occurred).

One function that is of particular use for users with remote databases
(be it @acronym{LDAP} or @acronym{SQL}) is the ``database override''
feature.  Using this you can have the security critical principals
(such as the ticket granting ticket) stored on local file system
storage, but use the remote database for user principals.  Of course,
you must keep the local file system storage synchronized between all
servers, as before.  Here is an example configuration.

@example
db --read-only file /var/local/master
db ldap kdc.example.org ca=/etc/shisa/kdc-ca.pem
@end example

This instruct the Shisa library to access the two databases
sequentially, for each query using the first database that know about
the requested principal.  If you put the @samp{krbtgt/REALM} principal
in the local @samp{file} database, this will override the
@acronym{LDAP} interface.  Naturally, you can have as many @samp{db}
definition lines as you wish.

@cindex High Availability
Users with remote databases can also investigate a so called @i{High
Availability} mode.  This is useful if you wish to have your Kerberos
servers be able to continue to operate even when the remote database
is offline.  This is achieved via the @samp{--ignore-errors} flag in
the database definition.  Here is a sample configuration.

@example
db --ignore-errors ldap kdc.example.org ca=/etc/shisa/kdc-ca.pem
db --read-only file /var/cache/ldap-copy
@end example

This instruct the Shisa library to try the @acronym{LDAP} backend
first, but if it fails, instead of returning an error, continue to try
the operation on a read only local @samp{file} based database.  Of
course, write requests will still fail, but it may be better than
halting the server completely.  To make this work, you first need to
set up a cron job on a, say, hourly basis, to make a copy of the
remote database and store it in the local file database.  That way,
when the remote server goes away, fairly current information will
still be available locally.

@cindex fail over
If you also wish to experiment with read-write fail over, here is an
idea for the configuration.

@example
db --ignore-errors ldap kdc.example.org ca=/etc/shisa/kdc-ca.pem
db --ignore-errors --read-only file /var/cache/ldap-copy
db file /var/cache/local-updates
@end example

This is similar to the previous, but it will ignore errors reading and
writing from the first two databases, ultimately causing write
attempts to end up in the final @samp{file} based database.  Of
course, you would need to create tools to feed back any local updates
made while the remote server was down.  It may also be necessary to
create a special backend for this purpose, which can auto create
principals that are used.

We finish with an example that demonstrate all the ideas presented.

@example
db --read-only file /var/local/master
db --ignore-errors ldap kdc.example.org ca=/etc/shisa/kdc-ca.pem
db --ignore-errors --read-only file /var/cache/ldap-copy
db file /var/cache/local-updates
@end example

@node Developer information
@section Developer information

Adding a new backend is straight forward.  You need to implement the
backend API function set, add the list of API functions to
@file{db/db.c} and possibly also add any library dependencies to the
Makefile.

The simplest way to write a new backend is to start from the existing
@samp{file} based database, in @file{db/file.c}, and modify the entry
points as needed.

Note that the current backend API will likely change several times
before it is frozen.  We may describe it in detail here when it has
matured.

There should be no need to modify anything else in the Shisa library,
and certainly not in the Shishi library or the @file{shishid} server.

Of course, we would appreciate if you would send us your new backend
if you believe it is generally useful (@pxref{Bug Reports}).

@node Shishi Configuration
@section Shishi Configuration
@cindex configuration file

The valid configuration file tokens are described here.  The user
configuration file is typically located in
@file{~/.shishi/shishi.conf} (compare @samp{shishi
--configuration-file}) and the system configuration is typically
located in @file{/usr/local/etc/shishi/shishi.conf} (compare
@samp{shishi --system-configuration-file}).  If the first non white
space character of a line is a '#', the line is ignored.  Empty lines
are also ignored.

All tokens are valid in both the system and the user configuration
files, and have the same meaning.  However, as the system file is
supposed to apply to all users on a system, it would not make sense to
use some tokens in that file.  For example, the
@samp{default-principal} is rarely useful in a system configuration
file.

@subsection @samp{default-realm}
Specify the default realm, by default the hostname of the host is
used.  E.g.,

@example
default-realm JOSEFSSON.ORG
@end example

@subsection @samp{default-principal}

Specify the default principal, by default the login username is
used. E.g.,

@example
default-principal jas
@end example

@subsection @samp{client-kdc-etypes}

Specify which encryption types client asks server to respond in during
AS/TGS exchanges. List valid encryption types, in preference order.
Supported algorithms include aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96,
aes128-cts-hmac-sha1-96, des3-cbc-sha1-kd, des-cbc-md5, des-cbc-md4,
des-cbc-crc and null.  This option also indicates which encryption
types are accepted by the client when receiving the response.  Note
that the preference order is not cryptographically protected, so a man
in the middle can modify the order without being detected.  Thus, only
specify encryption types you trust completely here. The default only
includes aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96, as suggested by RFC1510bis.  E.g.,

@example
client-kdc-etypes=aes256-cts-hmac-sha1-96 des3-cbc-sha1-kd des-cbc-md5
@end example

@subsection @samp{verbose}, @samp{verbose-asn1}, @samp{verbose-noice}, @samp{verbose-crypto}

Enable verbose library messages.  E.g.,

@example
verbose
verbose-noice
@end example

@subsection @samp{realm-kdc}

Specify KDC addresses for realms.  Value is
@samp{REALM,KDCADDRESS[/PROTOCOL][,KDCADDRESS[/PROTOCOL]...]}.

KDCADDRESS is the hostname or IP address of KDC.

Optional PROTOCOL is udp for UDP, tcp for TCP, and TLS for TLS
connections.  By default UDP is tried first, and TCP used as a
fallback if the KRB_ERR_RESPONSE_TOO_BIG error is received.

If not specified, Shishi tries to locate the KDC using SRV RRs,
which is recommended.  This option should normally only be
used during experiments, or to access badly maintained realms.

@example
realm-kdc=JOSEFSSON.ORG,ristretto.josefsson.org
@end example

@subsection @samp{server-realm}

Specify realm for servers. Value is
@samp{REALM,SERVERREGEXP[,SERVERREGEXP...]}.

SERVERREGEXP is a regular expression matching servers in the realm.
The first match is used.  E.g.,

@example
server-realm=JOSEFSSON.ORG,.josefsson.org
@end example

Note: currently not used.

@subsection @samp{kdc-timeout}, @samp{kdc-retries}

How long shishi waits for a response from a KDC before continuing to
next KDC for realm.  The default is 5 seconds.  E.g.,

@example
kdc-timeout=10
@end example

How many times shishi sends a request to a KDC before giving up.  The
default is 3 times.  E.g.,

@example
kdc-retries=5
@end example

@subsection @samp{stringprocess}

How username and passwords entered from the terminal, or taken from
the command line, are processed.

"none": no processing is used.

"stringprep": convert from locale charset to UTF-8 and process using
              experimental RFC 1510 stringprep profile.

It can also be a string indicating a character set supported by
iconv via libstringprep, in which case data is converted from locale
charset into the indicated character set. E.g., UTF-8, ISO-8859-1,
KOI-8, EBCDIC-IS-FRISS are supported on GNU systems.  On some systems
you can use "locale -m" to list available character sets.  By default,
the "none" setting is used which is consistent with RFC 1510 that is
silent on the issue.  In practice, however, converting to UTF-8
improves interoperability.

E.g.,

@example
stringprocess=UTF-8
@end example

@subsection @samp{ticket-life}
Specify default ticket life time.

The string can be in almost any common format.  It can contain month
names, time zones, `am' and `pm', `yesterday', `ago', `next', etc.
Refer to the "Date input formats" in the GNU CoreUtils package for
entire story (@pxref{Date input formats, ,Date input formats,
coreutils, GNU CoreUtils}).  As an extra feature, if the resulting
string you specify has expired within the last 24 hours, an extra day
is added to it.  This allows you to specify "17:00" to always mean the
next 17:00, even if your system clock happens to be 17:30.

The default is 8 hours.

E.g.,

@example
#ticket-life=8 hours
#ticket-life=1 day
ticket-life=17:00
@end example

@subsection @samp{renew-life}

Specify how long a renewable ticket should remain renewable.

See ticket-life for the syntax.  The extra feature that handles
negative values within the last 2 hours is not active here.

The default is 7 days.

E.g.,

@example
#renew-life=1 week
#renew-life=friday 17:00
renew-life=sunday
@end example

@node Shisa Configuration
@section Shisa Configuration
@cindex database definition
@cindex specifying user database
@cindex user database definition

The configuration file for Shisa is typically stored in
@file{/usr/local/etc/shishi/shisa.conf}.  If the first non white space
character of a line is a '#', the line is ignored.  Empty lines are
also ignored.

@subsection @samp{db}

Currently the only configuration options available is the @code{db}
token that define the databases to use.  The syntax is:

@example
db [OPTIONS] <TYPE> [LOCATION] [PARAMETERS ...]
@end example

Specify the data sources for Kerberos 5 data.  Multiple entries,
even of the same data source type, are allowed.  The data sources
are accessed in the same sequence as they are defined here.  If an
entry is found in one data source, it will be used for the
operations, without searching the remaining data sources.  Valid
OPTIONS include:

@example
--read-only       No data is written to this data source.
--ignore-errors   Ignore failures in this backend.
@end example

The default (when the configuration file is empty) uses one "file"
data source (see below), but for a larger installation you may want to
combine several data sources.  Here is an example.

@example
db --read-only file /var/local/master
db --ignore-errors ldap kdc.example.org ca=/etc/shisa/kdc-ca.pem
db --read-only file /var/cache/ldap-copy
@end example

This demonstrate how you can store critical principals on local disk
(the first entry, /var/local/master) that will always be found without
looking in the LDAP directory.  The critical principals could be,
e.g., krbtgt/EXAMPLE.ORG.  The second entry denote a LDAP server that
could hold user principals.  As you can see, Shisa will not let the
caller know about errors with the LDAP source (they will be logged,
however).  Instead, if for instance the LDAP server has crashed, Shisa
would continue and read from the /var/cache/ldap-copy file source.
That file source may have been set up to contain a copy of the data in
the LDAP server, perhaps made on an hourly basis, so that your server
will be able to serve recent data even in case of a crash.  Any
updates or passwords change requests will however not be possible
while the LDAP server is inaccessible, to reduce the problem of
synchronizing data back into the LDAP server once it is online again.

Currently only the "file" data source is supported, and denote a
data source that use the standard file system for storage.

Valid syntaxes for the "file" database:

@example
db file PATH
@end example

Examples:

@example
db file /var/shishi
db file /usr/share/shishi read-only
@end example

If no @samp{db} tokens are present, the default will be:

@example
db file /usr/local/var/shishi
@end example

@node Parameters for shishid
@section Parameters for shishid

If no parameters are specified, @samp{shishid} listens on the defaults
interfaces and answers incoming requests using the keys in the default
key file.

Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.

@example
  -c, --configuration-file=FILE   Read configuration from file.  Default is

@node Preparation
@section Preparation

To use `Libshishi', you have to perform some changes to your sources
and the build system.  The necessary changes are small and explained
in the following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it is
described how the library is initialized, and how the requirements of
the library are verified.

A faster way to find out how to adapt your application for use with
`Libshishi' may be to look at the examples at the end of this manual
(@pxref{Examples}).

@menu
* Header::
* Initialization::
* Version Check::
* Building the source::
* Autoconf tests::
@end menu

@node Header
@subsection Header

All interfaces (data types and functions) of the library are defined
in the header file `shishi.h'.  You must include this in all programs
using the library, either directly or through some other header file,
like this:

@example
#include <shishi.h>
@end example

The name space of `Libshishi' is @code{shishi_*} for function names,
@code{Shishi*} for data types and @code{SHISHI_*} for other symbols.  In
addition the same name prefixes with one prepended underscore are
reserved for internal use and should never be used by an application.

@node Initialization
@subsection Initialization

`Libshishi' must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized by calling @code{shishi_init} (@pxref{Initialization
Functions}).  The resources allocated by the initialization process
can be released if the application no longer has a need to call
`Libshishi' functions, this is done by calling @code{shishi_done}.

In order to take advantage of the internationalisation features in
`Libshishi', such as translated error messages, the application must
set the current locale using @code{setlocale} before initializing
`Libshishi'.

@node Version Check
@subsection Version Check

It is often desirable to check that the version of `Libshishi' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary
compatibility new features may have been introduced but due to problem
with the dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may
want to check that the version is okay right after program startup.

@include texi/shishi_check_version.texi

The normal way to use the function is to put something similar to the
following early in your @code{main}:

@example
  if (!shishi_check_version (SHISHI_VERSION))
    @{
      printf ("shishi_check_version failed:\n"
              "Header file incompatible with shared library.\n");
      exit(1);
    @}
@end example

@node Building the source
@subsection Building the source
@cindex Compiling your application

If you want to compile a source file including the `shishi.h' header
file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the @option{-I} option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, `Libshishi' uses the
external package @command{pkg-config} that knows the path to the
include file and other configuration options.  The options that need
to be added to the compiler invocation at compile time are output by
the @option{--cflags} option to @command{pkg-config shishi}.  The
following example shows how it can be used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config shishi --cflags`
@end example

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config shishi --cflags} to the
compilers command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
`Libshishi' header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search path
(via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option @option{--libs} to
@command{pkg-config shishi} can be used.  For convenience, this option
also outputs all other options that are required to link the program
with the `Libshishi' libararies (in particular, the @samp{-lshishi}
option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o} with the `Libshishi'
library to a program @command{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config shishi --libs`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config}:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config shishi --cflags --libs`
@end example

@node Autoconf tests
@subsection Autoconf tests
@cindex Autoconf tests
@cindex Configure tests

If you work on a project that uses Autoconf (@pxref{top, GNU
Autoconf,, autoconf}) to help find installed libraries, the
suggestions in the previous section are not the entire story.  There
are a few methods to detect and incorporate Shishi into your Autoconf
based package.  The preferred approach, is to use Libtool in your
project, and use the normal Autoconf header file and library tests.

@subsubsection Autoconf test via @samp{pkg-config}

If your audience is a typical GNU/Linux desktop, you can often assume
they have the @samp{pkg-config} tool installed, in which you can use
its Autoconf M4 macro to find and set up your package for use with
Shishi.  The following illustrate this scenario.

@example
AC_ARG_ENABLE(kerberos_v5,
	AC_HELP_STRING([--disable-kerberos_v5],
                       [don't use the KERBEROS_V5 mechanism]),
	kerberos_v5=$enableval)
if test "$kerberos_v5" != "no" ; then
	PKG_CHECK_MODULES(SHISHI, shishi >= 0.0.0,
			[kerberos_v5=yes],
                        [kerberos_v5=no])
	if test "$kerberos_v5" != "yes" ; then
		kerberos_v5=no
		AC_MSG_WARN([shishi not found, disabling Kerberos 5])
	else
		kerberos_v5=yes
		AC_DEFINE(USE_KERBEROS_V5, 1,
                          [Define to 1 if you want Kerberos 5.])
	fi
fi
AC_MSG_CHECKING([if Kerberos 5 should be used])
AC_MSG_RESULT($kerberos_v5)
@end example

@subsubsection Standalone Autoconf test using Libtool

If your package uses Libtool(@pxref{top, GNU Libtool,, libtool}), you
can use the normal Autoconf tests to find the Shishi library and rely
on the Libtool dependency tracking to include the proper dependency
libraries (e.g., Libidn).  The following illustrate this scenario.

@example
AC_CHECK_HEADER(shishi.h,
	AC_CHECK_LIB(shishi, shishi_check_version,
		[kerberos5=yes AC_SUBST(SHISHI_LIBS, -lshishi)],
		kerberos5=no),
	kerberos5=no)
AC_ARG_ENABLE(kerberos5,
	AC_HELP_STRING([--disable-kerberos5],
                       [disable Kerberos 5 unconditionally]),
	kerberos5=$enableval)
if test "$kerberos5" != "no" ; then
	AC_DEFINE(USE_KERBEROS_V5, 1,
		  [Define to 1 if you want Kerberos 5.])
else
	AC_MSG_WARN([Shishi not found, disabling Kerberos 5])
fi
AC_MSG_CHECKING([if Kerberos 5 should be used])
AC_MSG_RESULT($kerberos5)
@end example

@subsubsection Standalone Autoconf test

If your package does not use Libtool, as well as detecting the Shishi
library as in the previous case, you must also detect whatever
dependencies Shishi requires to work (e.g., libidn).  Since the
dependencies are in a state of flux, we do not provide an example and
we do not recommend this approach, unless you are experienced
developer.

@section AS/TGS Functions

The Authentication Service (AS) is used to get an initial ticket using
e.g. your password.  The Ticket Granting Service (TGS) is used to get
subsequent tickets using other tickets.  Protocol wise the procedures
are very similar, which is the reason they are described together.
The following illustrates the AS-REQ, TGS-REQ and AS-REP, TGS-REP
ASN.1 structures.  Most of the functions use the mnemonic ``KDC''
instead of either AS or TGS, which means the function operates on both
AS and TGS types.  Only where the distinction between AS and TGS is
important are the AS and TGS names used.  Remember, these are
low-level functions, and normal applications will likely be satisfied
with the AS (@pxref{AS Functions}) and TGS (@pxref{TGS Functions})
interfaces, or the even more high-level Ticket Set (@pxref{Ticket Set
Functions}) interface.

An ``Authenticator'' is a ASN.1 structure that work as a proof that an
entity owns a ticket.  It is usually embedded in the AP-REQ structure
(@pxref{AP-REQ and AP-REP Functions}), and you most likely want to use
an AP-REQ instead of a Authenticator in normal applications.  The

@node Cryptographic Functions
@section Cryptographic Functions

Underneath the high-level functions described earlier, cryptographic
operations are happening.  If you need to access these cryptographic
primitives directly, this section describes the functions available.

Most cryptographic operations need keying material, and cryptographic
keys have been isolated into it's own data structure
@code{Shishi_key}.  The following illustrates it's contents, but note
that you cannot access it's elements directly but must use the
accessor functions described below.

@verbatim
struct Shishi_key
{
  int type;    /* RFC 1510 encryption integer type */
  char *value; /* Cryptographic key data */
  int version; /* RFC 1510 ``kvno'' */
};
@end verbatim

All functions that operate on this data structure are described now.

@include texi/key.c.texi

Applications that run uninteractively may need keying material.  In
these cases, the keys are stored in a file, a file that is normally
stored on the local host.  The file should be protected from
unauthorized access.  The file is in ASCII format and contains keys as
outputed by @code{shishi_key_print}.  All functions that handle these
keys sets are described now.

@include texi/keys.c.texi

The previous functions require that the filename is known.  For some
applications, servers, it makes sense to provide a system default.
These key sets used by server applications are known as ``hostkeys''.
Here are the functions that operate on hostkeys (they are mostly
wrappers around generic key sets).

@include texi/hostkeys.c.texi

After creating the key structure, it can be used to encrypt and
decrypt data, calculate checksum on data etc.  All available functions
are described now.

@include texi/crypto.c.texi

An easier way to use encryption and decryption if your application
repeatedly calls, e.g., @code{shishi_encrypt_ivupdate}, is to use the
following functions.  They store the key, initialization vector, etc,
in a context, and the encryption and decryption operations update the
IV within the context automatically.

@include texi/crypto-ctx.c.texi

Also included in Shishi is an interface to the really low-level
cryptographic primitives.  They map directly on the underlying
cryptographic library used (e.g., Nettle) and is used internally by
Shishi.

Most functions in `Libshishi' are returning an error if they fail.
For this reason, the application should always catch the error
condition and take appropriate measures, for example by releasing the
resources and passing the error up to the caller, or by displaying a
descriptive message to the user and cancelling the operation.

Some error values do not indicate a system error or an error in the
operation, but the result of an operation that failed properly.

@subsection Error Values

Errors are returned as an @code{int}.  Except for the SHISHI_OK case,
an application should always use the constants instead of their
numeric value.  Applications are encouraged to use the constants even
for SHISHI_OK as it improves readability.  Possible values are:

@table @code
@item SHISHI_OK
This value indicates success.  The value of this error is guaranteed
to always be @code{0} so you may use it in boolean constructs.

@cindex Examples

This section will be extended to contain walk-throughs of example code
that demonstrate how `Shishi' is used to write your own applications
that support Kerberos 5.  The rest of the current section consists of
some crude hints for the example client/server applications that is
part of Shishi, taken from an email but saved here for lack of a
better place to put it.

There are two programs: 'client' and 'server' in src/.

The client output an AP-REQ, waits for an AP-REP, and then simply
reads data from stdin.

The server waits for an AP-REQ, parses it and prints an AP-REP, and
then read data from stdin.

Both programs accept a Kerberos server name as the first command line
argument.  Your KDC must know this server, since the client tries to
get a ticket for it (first it gets a ticket granting ticket for the
default username), and you must write the key for the server into
/usr/local/etc/shishi.keys on the Shishi format, e.g.:

@example
-----BEGIN SHISHI KEY-----
Keytype: 16 (des3-cbc-sha1-kd)
Principal: sample/latte.josefsson.org
Realm: JOSEFSSON.ORG
 
8W0VrQQBpxlACPQEqN91EHxbvFFo2ltt
-----END SHISHI KEY-----
@end example

You must extract the proper encryption key from the KDC in some way.
(This part will be easier when Shishi include a KDC, a basic one isn't
far away, give me a week or to.)

The intention is that the data read, after the authentication phase,
should be protected using KRB_SAFE (see RFC) but I haven't added this
yet.

@node Generic Security Service
@section Generic Security Service
@cindex Generic Security Service
@cindex GSS-API
@cindex GSSLib

As an alternative to the native Shishi programming API, it is possible
to program Shishi through the Generic Security Services (GSS) API.
The advantage of using GSS-API in your security application, instead
of the native Shishi API, is that it will be easier to port your
application between different Kerberos 5 implementations, and even
beyond Kerberos 5 to different security systems, that support GSS-API.
In the free software world, however, almost the only widely used
security system that supports GSS-API is Kerberos 5, so the last
advantage is somewhat academic.  But if you are porting applications
using GSS-API for other Kerberos 5 implementations, or want a more
mature and stable API than the native Shishi API, you may find using
Shishi's GSS-API interface compelling.  Note that GSS-API only offer
basic services, for more advanced uses you must use the native API.

Since the GSS-API is not specific to Shishi, it is distributed
independently from Shishi.  Further information on the GSS project can
be found at @url{http://josefsson.org/gss/}.

@node STARTTLS protected KDC exchanges
@section STARTTLS protected KDC exchanges

Shishi is able to ``upgrade'' TCP communications with the KDC to use
the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.  The TLS protocol offers
integrity and privacy protected exchanges.  TLS also offers
authentication using username and passwords, X.509 certificates, or
OpenPGP certificates.  Kerberos 5 claims to offer some of these
features, although it is not as rich as the TLS protocol.  An
inconclusive list of the motivation for using TLS is given below.

@itemize @bullet

@item Server authentication of the KDC to the client.
In traditional Kerberos 5, KDC authentication is only proved as a side
effect that the KDC knows your encryption key (i.e., your password).

@item Client authentication against KDC.
Kerberos 5 assume the user knows a key (usually in the form of a
password).  Sometimes external factors make this hard to fulfill.  In
some situations, users are equipped with smart cards with a RSA
authentication key.  In others, users have a OpenPGP client on their
desktop, with a public OpenPGP key known to the server.  In some
situations, the policy may be that password authentication may only be
done through SRP.

@item Kerberos exchanges are privacy protected.
Part of many Kerberos packets are transfered without privacy
protection (i.e., encryption).  That part contains information, such
as the client principal name, the server principal name, the
encryption types supported by the client, the lifetime of tickets,
etc.  Revealing such information is, in some threat models, considered
a problem.  Thus, this enables ``anonymity''.

@item Prevents downgrade attacks affecting encryption types.
The encryption type of the ticket in KDC-REQ are sent in the clear in
Kerberos 5.  This allows an attacker to replace the encryption type
with a compromised mechanisms, e.g. 56-bit DES.  Since clients in
general cannot know the encryption types other servers support, it is
difficult for the client to detect if there was a man-in-the-middle or
if the remote server simply did not support a stronger mechanism.
Clients may chose to refuse 56-bit DES altogether, but in some
environments this leads to operational difficulties.

@item TLS is well-proved and the protocol is studied by many parties.
This is an advantage in network design, where TLS is often already
assumed as part of the solution since it is used to protect HTTP,
IMAP, SMTP etc.  In some threat models, the designer prefer to reduce
the number of protocols that can hurt the overall system security if
they are compromised.

@end itemize

Other reasons for using TLS exists.

@subsection TCP/IP transport with TLS upgrade (STARTTLS)

RFC 1510bis requires Kerberos servers (KDCs) to accept TCP requests.
Each request and response is prefixed by a 4 octet integer in network
byte order, indicating the length of the packet.  The high bit of the
length was reserved for future expansion, and servers that do not
understand how to interpret a set high bit must return a
@code{KRB-ERROR} with a @code{KRB_ERR_FIELD_TOOLONG} and close the TCP
stream.

The TCP/IP transport with TLS upgrade (STARTTLS) uses this reserved
bit as follows.  First we define a new extensible typed hole for
Kerberos 5 messages, because we used the only reserved bit.  It is
thus prudent to offer future extensions on our proposal.  Secondly we
reserve two values in this new typed hole, and described how they are
used to implement STARTTLS.

@subsection Extensible typed hole based on reserved high bit

When the high bit is set, the remaining 31 bits of the 4 octets are
treated as an extensible typed hole, and thus form a 31 bit integer
enumerating various extensions.  Each of the values indicate a
specific extended operation mode, two of which are used and defined
here, and the rest are left for others to use.  If the KDC do not
understand a requested extension, it MUST return a @code{KRB-ERROR}
with a @code{KRB_ERR_FIELD_TOOLONG} value (prefixed by the 4 octet
length integer, with the high bit clear, as usual) and close the TCP
stream.

Meaning of the 31 lower bits in the 4 octet field, when the high bit
is set:

@verbatim
 0               RESERVED.
 1               STARTTLS requested by client.
 2               STARTTLS request accepted by server.
 3...2147483647  AVAILABLE for registration (via bug-shishi@josefsson.org).
 2147483648      RESERVED.
@end verbatim

@subsection STARTTLS requested by client (extension mode 1)

When this is sent by the client, the client is requesting the server
to start TLS negotiation on the TCP stream.  The client MUST NOT start
TLS negotiation immediately.  The client should wait for either a
KRB-ERROR (sent normally, prefixed by a 4 octet length integer)
indicating it does not understand the set high bit, or 4 octet which
is to interpreted as an integer in network byte order, where the high
bit is set and the remaining 31 bit are interpreted as an integer
specifying the ``STARTTLS request accepted by server''.  In the first
case, the client infer that the server do not understand (or wish to
support) STARTTLS, and can re-try using normal TCP, if unprotected
Kerberos 5 exchanges are allowed by client policy.  In the latter
case, it should invoke TLS negotiation on the stream.  If any other
data is received, the client MUST close the TCP stream.

@subsection STARTTLS request accepted by server (extension mode 2)

This 4 octet message should be sent by the server when it has received
the previous 4 octet message.  The message is an acknowledgment of the
client's request to initiate STARTTLS on the channel.  The server MUST
then invoke a TLS negotiation.

@subsection Proceeding after successful TLS negotiation

If the TLS negotiation ended successfully, possibly also considering
client or server policies, the exchange within the TLS protected
stream is performed like normal UDP Kerberos 5 exchanges, i.e., there
is no TCP 4 octet length field before each packet.

The server MAY consider the authentication performed by the TLS
exchange as sufficient to issue Kerberos 5 tickets to the client,
without requiring pre-authentication or the like.  However, it is not
an error to carry out pre-authentication as well.  We are currently
experimenting with this mode of operation.

@subsection Proceeding after failed TLS negotiation

If the TLS negotiation fails, possibly due to client or server policy
(e.g., inadequate support of encryption types in TLS, or lack of
client or server authentication) the entity that detect the failure
should abort or re-try as appropriate, up to local policy.

@subsection Security considerations

No channel bindings are provided in the Kerberos messages.  It is an
open question whether, and how, this should be fixed.

Because the initial token is not protected, it is possible for an
active attacker to make it appear to the client that the server do not
support this extension.  It is up to client configuration to disallow
non-TLS connections, if this is deemed unacceptable.

@node Telnet encryption with AES-CCM
@section Telnet encryption with AES-CCM

This appendix describe how Shishi use the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) encryption algorithm in Counter with CBC-MAC mode (RFC 3610)
with the telnet encryption option (RFC 2946).

@subsection Command Names and Codes

@verbatim
Encryption Type

      AES_CCM             12

Suboption Commands

      AES_CCM_INFO         1
      AES_CCM_INFO_OK      2
      AES_CCM_INFO_BAD     3
@end verbatim

@subsection Command Meanings

@verbatim
   IAC SB ENCRYPT IS AES_CCM AES_CCM_INFO <M> <L> <nonce> IAC SE
@end verbatim

The sender of this command select desired M and L parameters, and
nonce, as described in RFC 3610, and sends it to the other side of the
connection.  The parameters and the nonce are sent in clear text.
Only the side of the connection that is WILL ENCRYPT may send the
AES_CCM_INFO command.

@verbatim
   IAC SB ENCRYPT REPLY AES_CCM AES_CCM_INFO_BAD IAC SE
@end verbatim

The sender of this command reject the parameters received in the
AES_CCM_INFO command.  Only the side of the connection that is DO
ENCRYPT may send the AES_CCM_INFO_BAD command.  The command MUST be
sent if the nonce field length does not match the selected value for
L.  The command MAY be sent if the receiver do not accept the
parameters for reason such as policy.  No capability is provided to
negotiate these parameters.

@verbatim
   IAC SB ENCRYPT REPLY AES_CCM AES_CCM_INFO_OK IAC SE
@end verbatim

The sender of this command accepts the parameters received in the
AES_CCM_INFO command.  Only the side of the connection that is DO
ENCRYPT may send the AES_CCM_INFO_BAD command.  The command MUST NOT
be sent if the nonce field length does not match the selected value
for L.

@subsection Implementation Rules

Once a AES_CCM_INFO_OK command has been received, the WILL ENCRYPT
side of the connection should do keyid negotiation using the ENC_KEYID
command.  Once the keyid negotiation has successfully identified a
common keyid, then START and END commands may be sent by the side of
the connection that is WILL ENCRYPT.  Data will be encrypted using the
AES-CCM algorithm, with the negotiated nonce and parameters M and L.
After each successful encryption and decryption, the nonce is treated
as an integer in network byte order, and incremented by one.

If encryption (decryption) is turned off and back on again, and the
same keyid is used when re-starting the encryption (decryption), the
intervening clear text must not change the state of the encryption
(decryption) machine.  In particular, the AES-CCM nonce must not be
re-set.

If a START command is sent (received) with a different keyid, the
encryption (decryption) machine must be re-initialized immediately
following the end of the START command with the new key and the
parameters sent (received) in the last AES_CCM_INFO command.

If a new AES_CCM_INFO command is sent (received), and encryption
(decryption) is enabled, the encryption (decryption) machine must be
re-initialized immediately following the end of the AES_CCM_INFO
command with the new nonce and parameters, and the keyid sent
(received) in the last START command.

If encryption (decryption) is not enabled when a AES_CCM_INFO command
is sent (received), the encryption (decryption) machine must be re-
initialized after the next START command, with the keyid sent
(received) in that START command, and the nonce and parameters sent
(received) in this AES_CCM_INFO command.

At all times MUST each end make sure that a AES-CCM nonce is not used
twice under the same encryption key.  The rules above help accomplish
this in an interoperable way.

@subsection Integration with the AUTHENTICATION telnet option

<<This section is slightly complicated.  Can't we simplify this?>>

As noted in the telnet ENCRYPTION option specifications, a keyid value
of zero indicates the default encryption key, as might be derived from
the telnet AUTHENTICATION option.  If the default encryption key
negotiated as a result of the telnet AUTHENTICATION option contains
less than 32 bytes (corresponding to two 128 bit keys), then the
AES_CCM option MUST NOT be offered or used as a valid telnet
encryption option.  Furthermore, depending on policy for key lengths,
the AES_CCM option MAY be disabled if the default encryption key
contain less than 48 bytes (for two 192 bit keys), or less than 64
bytes (for two 256 bit keys), as well.

The available encrypt key data is divided on two halves, where the
first half is used to encrypt data sent from the server (decrypt data
received by the client), and the second half is used to encrypt data
sent from the client (decrypt data received by the server).

Note that the above algorithm assumes that the AUTHENTICATION
mechanism generate keying material suitable for AES-CCM as used in
this specification.  This is not necessarily true in general, but we
specify this behaviour as the default since it is true for most
authentication systems in popular use today.  New telnet
AUTHENTICATION mechanisms may specify alternative methods for
determining the keys to be used for this cipher suite in their
specification, if the session key negotiated by that authentication
mechanism is not a DES key and and where this algorithm may not be
safely used.

Kerberos 5 authentication clarification: The key used to encrypt data
from the client to the server is taken from the sub-session key in the
AP-REQ.  The key used to decrypt data from the server to the client is
taken from the sub-session key in the AP-REP.  If mutual
authentication is not negotiated, the key used to encrypt data from
the client to the server is taken from the session key in the ticket,
and the key used to decrypt data from the server to the client is
taken from the sub-session key in the AP-REQ.  Leaving the AP-REQ
sub-key field empty MUST disable the AES_CCM option.

@subsection Security Considerations

The protocol must be properly and securely implemented.  For example,
an implementation should not be vulnerable to various
implementation-specific attacks such as buffer overflows or
side-channel analysis.

We wish to repeat the suggestion from RFC 2946, to investigate in a
STARTTLS approach for Telnet encryption (and also authentication),
when the security level provided by this specification is not
adequate.

@subsubsection Telnet Encryption Protocol Security Considerations

The security consideration of the Telnet encryption protocol are
inherited.

It should be noted that the it is up to the authentication protocol
used, if any, to bind the authenticity of the peers to a specific
session.

The Telnet encryption protocol does not, in general, protect against
possibly malicious downgrading to any mutually acceptable, but not
preferred, encryption type.  This places a requirement on each peer to
only accept encryption types it trust fully.  In other words, the
Telnet encryption protocol do not guarantee that the strongest
mutually acceptable encryption type is always selected.

@subsubsection AES-CCM Security Considerations

The integrity and privacy claims are inherited from AES-CCM.  In
particular, the implementation must make sure a nonce is not used more
than once together with the same key.

Furthermore, the encryption key is assumed to be random, i.e., it
should not be possible to guess it with probability of success higher
than guessing any uniformly selected random key.  RFC 1750 gives an
overview of issues and recommendations related to randomness.

@subsection Acknowledgments

2946, RFC 2947, RFC 2948, RFC 2952 and RFC 2953).

@node Kerberized rsh and rlogin
@section Kerberized rsh and rlogin

This appendix describe the KCMDV0.2 protocol used in shishi patched
version of inetutils. The KCMD protocol was developped by the MIT
Kerberos team for kerberized rsh an rlogin programs. Differences
between rlogin an rsh will be explained, like those between v0.1 and
v0.2 of the protocol for compatibility reasons.
It is possible that some parts of this document are not in conformity
with original KCMD protocol because there is no official specification
about it. However, it seems that shishi implementation is compatible
with MIT's one.

@subsection Establish connection

First the client should establish a TCP connection with the
server. Default ports are 543 (klogin), 544 (kshell), 2105 (eklogin).
eklogin is the same as klogin but with encryption. Their is no longer
ekshell port because encrypted and normal connection use the same port
(kshell).
Kshell need a second connection for stderr. The client should send a
null terminated string that represent the port of this second
connection.
Klogin and eklogin does not use a second connection for stderr so the
client must send a null byte to the server.
Contrary to classic rsh/rlogin, server must not check if the client
port is in the range 0-1023. 

@subsection Kerberos identification

When connections are established, first thing to do is to indicate
kerberos authentication must be used.
So the client will send a string to indicate it will used kerberos
5. It will call a length-string "strl" the couple (lenght of the string
strl, null terminated string strl). Length of the string is an int32
(32bits int) in MSB order (for the network).
So the client send this length-string strl :

@verbatim
   KRB5_SENDAUTH_V1.0
@end verbatim

After that the client must indicate which version of the protocol it
will used by sending this length-string strl :

@verbatim
   KCMDV0.2
@end verbatim

It can be V0.1 for older versions.
If indentification from client is good, server will send a null
byte (0x00). Else if authentication message is wrong, server send byte
0x01, else if protocol version message is wrong server send byte 0x02.

@subsection Kerberos authentication

When client is indentified, kerberos authentication can begin. The
client must send an AP-REQ to the server. AP-REQ authenticator must
have a subkey (only for KCMDV0.2) and a checksum.
Authenticator checksum is created on following string :

@example
"serverport:""terminaltype""remoteusername"
@end example

for example :

@example
543:linux/38400user
@end example

remoteusername corresponds to the identity of the client on remote machine.

AP-REQ is sended in der encoded format. The length (int32) of der
encoded AP-REQ is sended in network format (MSB), following by the der
encoded AP-REQ.
If all is correct, server send a null int32 (MSB format but like it is
null it is not important).
KCMD protocol use mutual authentication, so server must now send and
AP-REP : (in32 lenght in MSB of der encoded AP-REP)(der encoded
AP-REP).

Now server and client are partially authenticated.

@subsection Extended authentication

Client must now send 3 different null terminated strings (without
lenght) :

@itemize
@item remote user name (user identity on remote machine)
@item terminal type for rlogin or command for rsh
@item local user name (user identity on client machine)
@end itemize

example for rsh :

@example
"rname\0"
"cat /usr/local/etc/shishi.conf"
"lname\0"
@end example

Server must verify that checksum in AP-REQ authenticator is correct by
computing a new hash like client has done.

Server must verify that principal (in AP-REQ) has right to log in on
the remote user account.
For the moment shishi only check if remote user name is equal to
principal. A more complex authorization code is planned.
Look at the end to know how MIT/Heimdal do to check authorization.

If all is correct server send a null byte, else an error message
string (null terminated string) is sent. User read the first byte. If
it is equal to zero, authentication is correct and is logged on the
remote host. Else user can read the error messsage send by the server.

@subsection Window size

For rlogin protocol, when authentication is complete, the server can
optionnaly send a message to ask for window terminal size of
user. Then the user can respond but it is not an obligation.

In KCMDV0.1 server send an urgent TCP message (MSG_OOB) with one byte
:

@example
TIOCPKT_WINDOW = 0x80
@end example

In KCMDV0.2 server does not send an urgent message but write on the
socket 5 bytes :

@example
'\377', '\377', 'o', 'o', TIOCPKT_WINDOW
@end example

If encryption is enabled (eklogin) server must send this 5 bytes
encrypted.

Client can answer in both protocol version with :
       
@example
'\377', '\377', 's', 's', "struct winsize"
@end example

The winsize structure is filled with corresponding setting to client's
terminal.
If encryption is enabled this answer must be send encrypted.

@subsection End of authentication

The "classic" rsh/rlogin can be used now.


@subsection Encryption

Encryption mode is used when a connection with eklogin is established.
Encryption with krsh can be used too. Before, there was a specific port
for that (ekshell), but now to indicate that encryption must be used with
krsh, client must add "-x " before the command when it send it between
remote user name and local user name.
When the client compute the checksum for AP-REQ authenticator the "-
x" must not be included.

Encryption in KCMDV0.2 is not the same as in KCMDV0.1. 
KCMDV0.1 uses ticket session key as encryption key, and use standard
Kerberos encryption functions. This protocol only supports des-cbc-crc,
des-cbc-md4, des-cbc-md5 and does not use initialisation vectors.

For example on each encryption/decryption calls, the following
prototype kerberos function should be used :
	 
@example
kerberos_encrypt (key, keyusage, in, out)  (or decrypt)
@end example

KCMDV0.2 can be used with all kerberos encryption modes (des, 3des,
aes, arcfour) and use AP-REQ authenticator subkey. In opposite to
KCMDV0.1 initialisation vectors are used. All encryptions/descryptions
must be made using a cryptographic context (for example to use the
updated iv, or sbox) :

@example
kerberos_init(ctx, iv, key, keyusage)
kerberos_encrypt (ctx, in, out)
@end example

For both protocols, keyusage id for des-cbc-md5, des-cbc-md4,
des-cbc-crc and des3-cbc-sha1 (for KCMDV0.2) :
	
@example    
keyusage = 1026
@end example

For other KCMDV0.2 modes keyusage is different for each
encryption/decryption usage.
To understand, eklogin use 1 socket. It encrypts data (output 1) to
send and decrypts (input 1) received data.
Kshell use 2 sockets (1 for transmit data, 1 for stderr). So there are
four modes :
     
@verbatim
   transmit  : input  1 
	       output 1

   stderr    : input  2
	       output 2
@end verbatim

There is a keyusage for each modes. The keyusage must correspond on
client and server side. For example in klogin client input 1 keyusage
will be server output 1 keyusage.

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .15
@item I/O @tab Client @tab Server
@item intput 1 @tab 1028 @tab 1030
@item output 1 @tab 1030 @tab 1028
@item intput 2 @tab 1032 @tab 1034
@item output 2 @tab 1034 @tab 1032
@end multitable

Those keyusages must be used with AES and ARCFOUR modes.

KCMDV0.2 uses IV (initialisation vector). Like for keyusage, client IV
must correspond to server IV. IV size is equal to key type,
blocksize. All bytes of IV must be initialised to :

@multitable @columnfractions .15 .15 .15
@item I/O @tab Client @tab Server
@item intput 1 @tab 0 @tab 1
@item output 1 @tab 1 @tab 0
@item intput 2 @tab 2 @tab 3
@item output 2 @tab 3 @tab 2
@end multitable

ARCFOUR mode does not use IV. However, like it is said before, a context
must be used to keep the updated sbox.

Normal message with klogin and kshell are sent like that :

@example
(int 32 lenght of message in MSB order)
(message)
@end example

In encrypted mode it is a bit different :

@example
(int 32 length of unencrypted message in MSB order)
(encrypted message)
@end example

In KCMDV0.2 encrypted message is create like that :

@example
encrypt (
(int 32 length of message in MSB order)
(message)
)
@end example

A check on message size can be made in second version of the protocol.

@subsection  KCMDV0.3


This part only gives possible ways to extend KCMD protocol. Does not
take that as must have in KCMD implementation.

Extensions of KCMV0.2 could be made. For example kshell supposes there
are no files with name "-x *". I think the same thing can be supposed
with terminal name for klogin. So client could add "-x " to terminal
type it sends to server to indicate it will use encryption. Like that
there will be only one port for klogin/eklogin : 543.

In encrypted mode kshell send command in clear on the network, this
could be considered as insecure as user have decided to use
encryption.
This is not really a problem for klogin because it just sends terminal
type.

In encrypted mode, klogin and kshell clients could only send "-x" as
command or terminal type.
After that encryption is activated, and the client could send terminal
type or command encrypted.
The server will send the null byte to say that all is correct, or
error message in encrypted form.

@subsection MIT/Heimdal authorization

This part describes how MIT/Heimdal version check authorization of the
user to log in on the remote machine.

Authorization check is made by looking if the file .k5login exists on
the account of the remote user.
If this file does not exist, remote user name must be the same as
principal in AP-REQ to valid authorization.
Else if this file exists, check first verify that remote user or root
are the owner of .k5login.
If it is not the case, the check fails.
If it is good, check reads each line of that file and compare each
readed name to principal.
If principal is found in .k5login, authorization is valid, else user
is not allowed to connect on remote host with the specified remote
user name (that can be the same as principal).

So someone (for example user "user1") can remote log into "user2"
account if .k5login is present in user2 home dir and this file is owned
by user2 or root and user1 name is present in this file.
